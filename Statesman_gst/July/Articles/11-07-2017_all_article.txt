Refuting reports that levy on sanitary napkins has been raised under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, the Finance Ministry on 10 July said the tax incidence on these will remain the same or lower."There are some remarks made by various column writers on GST rate on sanitary napkins. It may be mentioned that the tax incidence on this item before and after GST is the same or less," the ministry said here in a statement."In pre-GST regime, sanitary napkins attracted concessional excise duty of 6 per cent and 5 per cent VAT. The pre-GST estimated total tax incidence on sanitary napkins was 13.68 per cent. Therefore, 12 per cent GST rate had been provided for sanitary napkin," it said.As raw materials for manufacture of sanitary napkins attract GST of 18 per cent and 12 per cent, even with 12 per cent GST on sanitary napkins, there in an inversion in the GST structure, it said.The main raw materials used for the manufacturing of sanitary napkins which attract 18 per cent rate are super absorbent polymer, poly ethylene film, glue, LLDPE-Packing Cover and those that attract 12 per cent tax are thermo bonded non-woven, release paper and wood pulp."Though within the existing GST law such accumulated Input Tax Credit (ITC) will be refunded, it will have associated financial costs (interest burden) and administrative cost, putting them at a disadvantage vis-a-vis imports, which will also attract 12 per cent Integrated GST on their imports, with no additional financial costs on account of fund blockage and associated administrative cost of refunds," it said.If the GST rate on sanitary napkins were to be reduced from 12 per cent to 5 per cent, it will further accentuate the tax inversion and result in even higher accumulated ITC, with correspondingly higher finical costs on account of fund blockage and associated administrative cost of refunds, putting domestic manufacturers at even greater disadvantage vis-a-vis imports, the ministry argued.However, reducing the GST rate on sanitary napkins to nil will result in complete denial of ITC to domestic manufacturers of sanitary napkins and zero rating imports. This will make domestically manufactured sanitary napkins at a huge disadvantage vis-a-vis imports, which will be zero-rated, it added.Women's rights groups and gynaecologists around the country have been protesting the 12 per cent tax on sanitary napkins, saying they are a necessity not a luxury and hence should not be taxed.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor on Tuesday said it will not change its plans for hybrid vehicles in India despite increase in tax rates on the category of vehicles under GST resulting in higher prices.Under the new tax regime, prices of the company's popular hybrid sedan Camry have gone up by an average of Rs.3 lakh.The model, which is assembled at the company's Bengaluru plant, now costs around Rs.35 lakh as against Rs.33 lakh earlier.Hybrid vehicles are on the same slab as luxury cars at 28 per cent GST plus 15 per cent cess at present. At 43 per cent, total tax incidence on these vehicles is higher from the previous effective tax rate of 30.3 per cent.“We will continue with this journey of hybrid vehicles in India. Our commitment remains the same and we believe that this technology is good for environment,” Toyota Kirloskar Motor Senior Vice President and Director N Raja told PTI here.He said the higher tax rate under GST has come as a set back but the company would continue with its pursuit to find new customers.“What has happened with GST is that hybrid customers, who are mostly large business owners are busy sorting out their businesses to comply with the new tax system. So, it's taking time for enquiries to convert into deliveries, “ Raja said.On the overall impact of GST, he said in June the company delivered about 2,000 units to its dealers in order to avoid stock pile up in the run up to its implementation. In the prior months the company delivered around 12,000 units.“From July we have resumed normal delivery and we expect to make up for the loss in June in the next three months,” he said.Commenting on the industry growth prospects, Raja said,”We believe that the industry will grow around 6-7 per cent and we should be able to keep pace with the same.”TKM on Tuesday launched smart phone application, Toyota Connect India to provide assistance to its customers for service, roadside assistance and navigation.“This has been launched keeping in mind the nature of our customers who are tech savvy and are expecting easier and convenient car ownership,” Raja said.
