Caution ahead of the launch of the country's biggest indirect tax reform — the Goods and Services Tax (GST) — tightened the bear grip over the Indian equity markets, which settled in the negative territory for the third week in a row.Weak global cues and June derivatives expiry, too, added to the volatility in the equity markets.On Friday, the 30-scrip Sensitive Index (Sensex) of the BSE closed at 30,921.61 points — down 216.60 points or 0.70 per cent from its previous week's close.The wider Nifty of the National Stock Exchange fell by 54.05 points or 0.56 per cent to close the week's trade at 9,520.90 points."Benchmark indices extended their losing streak to the third consecutive week as traders and investors continued to trade cautiously ahead of the GST rollout. Outflows of foreign funds and weak global cues further added to the concerns," Vijay Singhania, Director of Trade Smart Online, told IANS.Provisional figures from the stock exchanges showed that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold stocks worth Rs 1,770.34 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased scrip worth Rs 1,964.91 crore during June 28-30."Overall, volatility ruled the roost throughout the week on account of a historic F&O (futures and options) expiry, which saw the highest turnover ever. Banking stocks remained in focus following reports of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) order seeking hefty provisions for accounts referred to bankruptcy courts," Singhania added.According to D.K. Aggarwal, Chairman and Managing Director, SMC Investments and Advisors, the global stock market witnessed sell-off during the week as investors grew cautious sparked by a delayed healthcare vote in the US."Also, sentiments were badly hit by the speculation that European Central Bank stimulus may be wound down if conditions improve. Back at home, market also witnessed volatile movements tracking global cues ahead of June derivatives expiry," said Aggarwal.Commenting on stock-specific movement, Sanjeev Zarbade, Vice President – PCG Research, Kotak Securities, said: "The RBI has increased the provisioning on accounts referred for bankruptcy, which led to weakness in bank stocks. Metals sector ended in the positive zone, which was attributed to rebound in global metal prices.""Oil and gas stocks fell tracking the global crude prices," Zarbade added.During the week, the Indian rupee weakened by five paise to 64.58 as against the US dollar from it's last week's close at 64.53 to a greenback.Figures from the National Securities Depository (NSDL) revealed that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) invested in a total of equities worth Rs 334.47 crore, or $51.9 million, during June 27-30.The top weekly Sensex gainers were: Tata Steel (up 7.28 per cent at Rs 544.35), ITC (up 4.18 per cent at Rs 323.85), Bharti Airtel (up 3.62 per cent at Rs 379.15), Power Grid (up 2.56 per cent at Rs 210.55) and Cipla (up 2.50 per cent at Rs 554.35).The losers were: State Bank of India (down 5.28 per cent at Rs 273.60), Tata Motors (down 4.55 per cent at Rs 263.30), Asian Paints (down 4.32 per cent at Rs 1,104.15), Reliance Industries (down 3.82 per cent at Rs 1,380.25), and Kotak Bank (down 3.04 per cent at Rs 955.45).
With the Goods and Services Tax (GST) coming into effect on Saturday, people took to social media to share their first bills of the day.Describing their first tryst with GST, neticizens shared their bills, mostly food bills, with friends on WhatsApp, Facebook or through Twitter.Some even posted their hotel bills of Friday and Saturday to highlight the impact of GST on their pocket.GST Council also started a hashtag #TrystwithGST to enable people to share their experience by tweeting a picture of first GST receipts.A bill showed how the cost of a South Indian meal has gone up with GST.A Masala Dosa and a Sambar Vada cost Rs 148 on Saturday against Rs 133 on Friday at the same restaurant in Bengaluru.A family shared on WhatsApp a bill of the food they had at a popular eatery in Hyderabad. They had to pay Rs 183 as GST (nine percent state GST and nine percent central GST) on a food bill of Rs 1,577.Some of the receipts at the grocery stores posted online show that five percent state GST and five percent central GST was levied on total purchase.

A day after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) came into practice, Apple on Saturday reduced the retail prices of iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watch models for its consumers in India.The Rs 60,000 Apple iPhone 7 (32GB variant) can now be purchased at Rs 56,200. The Rs 70,000 iPhone 7 (128GB) is now available for Rs 65,200 and the Rs 80,000 256GB variant at Rs 74,400.The base model (32GB) of Apple iPhone 7 Plus is now available at Rs 67,300 as opposed to Rs 72,000 previously.The 32GB model of iPhone SE (Rs 27,200), being assembled in Bengaluru, will now cost Rs 26,000. The 32GB iPhone 6s (Rs 50,000) is now available at Rs 46,900.The new prices have taken the basic customs duty (BCD) of 10 per cent into account."I think it is a good move ahead of the upcoming festive season. We believe the best way for Apple to increase their share in India is to bridge the gap between affordability and aspirational value of iPhone. Even in the past, they have tasted success with 4S, 5S and iPhone 6 when reduced the price," Tarun Pathak, Senior Analyst, Mobile Devices and Ecosystems at New Delhi-based Counterpoint Research, told IANS."By the end of 2017, we believe iPhone 6 and SE can be the flagships through which most users are going to enter the Apple ecosystem for the first time ever," Pathak added.India has gained a significant place in the Apple scheme of things in the recent past.Apple CEO Tim Cook recently told Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was visiting the US, that his company is positive about the production of the iPhone SE in Bengaluru.According to industry sources, Cook apprised the Prime Minister about the production of Apple's popular iPhone SE model at its Bengaluru facility and the app developers working for Apple.In May, Apple began the initial production of a small number of iPhone SE in Bengaluru, where it had opened its App Accelerator to provide specialised support for developers earlier this year in March.Apart from iPhones, Apple also slashed prices of iPads, Macs and Apple Watch.According to experts, the price drop post-GST will help Apple cement its position in the challenging Indian market. Currently, Apple has 3 per cent market share by volume and 11 per cent by value in the country.
Day 1 of the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), touted as a game-changing economic reform, saw little effect in the Capital’s markets. Shopkeepers felt the prices of essential commodities, fruits, vegetables, and medicines will remain the same for at least a fortnight."There is total confusion regarding the billing of the items in GST. I have almost all slabs of commodities. But do not know how to rate them according to GST. I asked my chartered accountant to rate prices according to the new tax regime, but he also does not know," said Anuj Gupta, who owns a grocery shop."Companies have ordered us to sell the garments at the same rate at present. After some time, they will inform us what to do," said Suraj Singh, who has a garment shop in Maharani Bagh. He said he had heard that the government will launch user-friendly software for billing the items.The customers were also confused over the duty structure under the GST regime. "I think, the wholesalers, traders and shopkeepers among others are confused over GST as most of them don't have any knowledge of GST levies on different goods," said Dhananjay Sinha, who runs a restaurant, adding that he is also confused over the new tax structure.Many vegetable sellers were clueless about GST. It was obvious that they had not heard of it before."We are selling the vegetables with the same rate as earlier. We bought them from the mandi at the same price too," said a group of vegetable sellers.On being asked about any change in prices of medicines and cosmetics, a pharmacist in Lajpat Nagar said, "For now we have not seen any change. Slowly it will come in the process and be applicable."Big Bazaar, the retail chain, offered discounts ranging from 2 to 22 per cent on select food and grocery items. The retailer announced a sale starting at midnight last night for two hours with new prices.According to an executive at the retail store, "Last night, stores across the country were shut for two-and-a- half hours from 9.30 p.m. to midnight to upgrade the new software and billing system."GST is an indirect tax applicable throughout the country which replaced multiple cascading taxes levied by the Central and state governments.
