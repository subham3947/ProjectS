With the roll out of the most awaited Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1 July, patients are apparently at a loss as chemists are denying discount of 10 per cent to 15 per cent which they earlier used to offer on medicines and cosmetics.A decision to this effect has been taken by the Chemist Association Chandigarh which claims the profit margin of chemists has gone down following the implementation of the GST and they are not in a position to give discount to patients.Chemists claim, due to GST, tax on medicines has increased from 5 per cent to 12 per cent and 18 per cent. While some of the essential drugs falls in the category of 5 per cent tax slab, but majority of other drugs fall under 12 per cent slab under GST, they said."Now the taxes have increased from 5 per cent to 18 per cent. So we cannot offer any discount. Chemists still have a huge pile of old stock and so to prevent the further loss of the chemists we have taken this decision of not offering any discount," Chemists Association Chandigarh, general secretary,Vinay Jain said. "But as soon as the skepticism over this tax regime will curtail down then we will try to give discounts. Only chemists located inside the government hospitals have to give discounts as per their tenders but they also have reduced their percentage of discount from 10 per cent to six per cent," he added.The owner of Shivangee medical shop located at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Shailesh Sanwaria, said, all chemists are baffled at present due to uncertainity over this tax structure under the GST.The owner, Paul Medical Hall, Sector 22, Yashpal Singla said the GST tax regime is quite confusing and with the increase in tax structure, there is now a difference of 7 per cent to 13 per cent."We are also confused with the reimbursement procedure for the extra tax paid by us. If we give discount to the customers then we have to bear the loss that is why we are hesitant to proffer any discount. But, we also don't want to lose our regular customers so if they demand and insists then we have to give them discount on our own loss", he said.The owner, Emm Kay Medicos, Sector 17, DC Gupta said pharmaceutical companies and wholesalers themselves are unsure about the GST. "The demand for the regular medicines like diabetes, cardiovascular , blood pressure etc have increased as there is shortage of supply and we are struggling to make ends meet," he said.

The tax slab is 12 per cent for us now, which is 0.5 per cent less than before. We are hoping that in the coming festival season the number of purchasers will increase,'' said Raghuvir Singh, the Manager of ML Departmental Stores (Hot Stoppers).Owner of Muskan Restaurant Sector17, Vijay Uppal said that the tax percentage charged is uncertain as previously he came under tax slab of 5 per cent and now the information showed him under tax slab of 12 per cent which is causing confusion.Another owner of a restaurant in Sector-22 said that now he is coming under 12 per cent tax slab, he cannot charge the customers for extra money. "The various tax slabs are growing arduous for the businessmen and is harming our business,'' he said.Due to the unclear tax rates under GST, many restaurant owners are avoiding to issue printed bills as they are unsure about the same.Some in the restaurant business, however, claim no GST effect on their business.A senior staffer at Hot Millions Restaurant said they are coming under the tax slab of 18 per cent which is quite neutral and the consumers have neither decreased or increased in the number.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) will severely dent the liquidity situation of traders and the compliance cost of merchant exporters may go up, top exporter body FIEO said on Friday.According to the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), export competitiveness of domestic players may fall by about 2 per cent due to liquidity problems.FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai said the government is looking into various options to neutralise the effect of GST regime.“GST will severely dent the liquidity of the exporter in a big way and the compliance cost of the merchant exporter may go up. Export competitiveness of India may tank by about 2 per cent and this will be a big blow to exporters,” he said in a statement.FIEO President Ganesh Kumar Gupta termed GST as a “path breaking” reform, but it will bear fruits in the long run with initial hiccups.He explained that the liquidity problem of the exporters, delays in initial returns for exports in July and August, procedural issues in bonds are being flagged by FIEO with the officials concerned. The issues were discussed in Mumbai on 13 July.Before GST, exporters used to get ab-initio exemptions from duties. But they have to pay first and then seek refund.Due to this process, the FIEO stated that about Rs.1,85,000 crore will get stuck with the government.
