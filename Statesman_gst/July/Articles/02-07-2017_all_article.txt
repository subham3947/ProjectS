The consumers will have to shell out more for the ready to move-in flats under the GST system as developers with large unsold inventories are planning to pass on the higher tax burden to home-buyers.However, the new flats will cost less, giving some breather to the developers of upcoming projects.Under GST, the effective tax on under-construction projects has gone up to 12 per cent, which is an increase of 6.5 per cent. The actual GST rate is 18 per cent on realty, but allows one-third of the tax to be deducted from the land value, from the total cost charged by the developer.The GST gives an option of getting full input set-off credit, which is not applicable on ready-to-move-in flats and as a result, developers will have to bear the burden of higher tax or pass on to the end-consumers or increase the overall prices to match the new tax burden, say developers.“While developers might still get some benefits for projects that are in nascent stages, they will have to bear the tax burden for the ready-to-move-in projects since they are kept out of the GST ambit,”Hiranandani Group Chairman and Managing Director Surendra Hiranandani said.Gera Developments Managing Director Rohit Gera said under the GST regime, tax on under construction projects would be 12 per cent, an increase of 6.5 per cent for buyers.“There is an option of getting full input set-off credit on all input side if GST is paid by them, but this is not applicable on ready-to-move-in properties,” he said.As a result, developers will either have to bear the burden of the tax since it cannot be passed on to the end consumers or the rates of apartments that are ready-to-occupy will increase to the extent of the taxes,” Gera said.Vinod S Menon, CEO of Bengaluru-based mid-market developer Citrus Ventures, says “everybody talks about the positives that GST brings in. But the devil lies in the details and no one seems to have any clarity on that.”Menon said though one-third deduction makes the effective rate 12 per cent, with current effective VAT plus service tax rate being nine per cent, there is still a three per cent incremental charge.Since no retrospective claim of credits is possible, this will be a bone of contention between customer and developer as to who will bear this, he said.Coupled with the new regulator Rera, GST will increase paperwork and thus the overall cost, Menon said.However, Knight Frank India Chairman Shishir Baijal said like the note-ban, GST would trigger some momentary disturbances but augur well for the industry in the long term.“The intention of GST is to bring in efficiency in the entire tax system, and its implementation will see some teething issues. But eventually it will pave the way for an extremely efficient tax system for the country,” he said.Echoing similar views, SILA founder and MD Sahil Vora said there will be pain and forced consolidation in the sector, but in the long-run everybody will benefit.“But the affordable housing sector is happy as there is no tax on it. Since almost 70 per cent of the market caters to the middle to high income segment, GST could shift focus, particularly of smaller developers towards high volume, low to medium income segment,” RICS Global's Sachin Sandhir said.Anarock Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said the affordable housing sector will not be impacted by GST as there will be no tax under GST for affordable housing scheme.CBRE South Asia's Ram Chandnani said GST will also attract international residential investment as it has been seen globally that a unified tax structure has been one of the many catalysts for increased investments.“Additionally, sectors ancillary to real estate will see improved supply chain efficiency with the removal of various federal tax barriers and creation of a common market, accelerating the delivery of goods,” he noted.Atul Chordia of Panchshil Realty said they have only completed or near-ready projects which will be paying 12 per cent GST on the cost of construction.“The effective 12 per cent tax is higher than the industry as we tend to use best-in-industry material, much of which will fall under the 28 per cent slab leading to higher overall cost,” Chordia said.India Ratings maintains a negative outlook for the real estate sector for FY18, on expectation of a continued slump in sale of residential units.This will lead to continued negative cash flows since FY14 and a further increase in already-high debt levels, resulting in weakening of the sector's credit profile.Rohit Jain, a partner at law firm Economic Laws Practice, said there isn't enough clarity on transitional provisions under GST, whether it pertains to credit of inventory, credit on unsold stock or the tax implications where part payments are made under the pre-GST and part under the new taxation system.
Stock markets this week may see volatile trading sessions and a few knee-jerk reactions following the launch of GST even it is expected to take cues from announcement of macroeconomic data, say experts."Investors will be closely watching how the GST implementation proceeds. Investors will be keenly awaiting minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's June meeting," VK Sharma, Head of Business PCG, HDFC Securities said.The Goods and Services Tax (GST) — India's biggest tax reform since independence — came into force on July 1 after 17 years of debate."The new regime is expected to re-colonize India's tax system but may face some initial hiccups on the implementation front. With valuation over-stretched, market is now facing selling pressure on lack of new growth triggers. We believe that GST could be one of the hooks that the market will justify for correction to set in," Vijay Singhania, Founder- Director, Trade Smart Online said.This week would also see stocks reacting to monthly auto sales numbers, he said adding global cues, crude oil and currency activity will also act as key factors that will dictate the direction."GST is likely to result in a near-term disruption as this is a massive reform which is getting implemented in our economy," Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking said."We expect markets to remain volatile and track the management commentary on how they are adjusting to the issues arisen due to the GST," Joshi said.Sector-specific movement can be seen after the launch of the much-awaited GST, experts said."One nation one tax is likely to be taken positively on Dalal Street on account of more clear taxation. Though we cannot rule out initial knee-jerk reaction. Further, auto stocks will also remain in the radar on the back of their monthly sales numbers. PMI data is also scheduled to be declared which will show the sign of macro economic activity happening," Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Director & Research Head, Amrapali Aadya Trading & Investments said.On the macro front, PMI data on manufacturing and services sectors will also have a bearing, experts added."Market is at the doorstep of new indirect tax system.Investors' sentiment and expectation may not be met in the short-term. But it will be positive for listed entities over the medium to long-term," Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services said.However, more than the domestic factors, it is the global risk that haunts us more, he noted.
Last week, the Sensex recorded a fall of 216.60 points, or 0.69 per cent, while the broader Nifty lost 54.05 points, or 0.56 per cent.India ushered in a new economic reality with a 60-minute star-studded midnight gala at the imposing Central Hall of Parliament, thus becoming only the seventh country in the world to have a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST).But away from the media glare and relentless public commentary, there were men and women who worked tirelessly to bring to fruition the country's biggest taxation overhaul since Independence.The rollout of the GST was in the making for over a decade, which was effected through an amendment to the Constitution and five supporting laws being passed by Parliament and state assemblies.Since the passage of the Constitution Amendment bill in August 2016, there were over 175 officers' meetings and 18 sittings of the GST Council — leading to 18,000-plus man hours of discussions for a smooth roll out of the new tax regime.A battery of Central and state government officials burnt the midnight oil to meet the July 1 target for launching the GST.Official sources said as many as 30 sub-groups and committees worked tirelessly to devise rules and laws as well as fix tax rates for over 1,200 goods and services.While the final decisions were taken by the GST Council comprising Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and his state counterparts, who met on an average twice a month in the last nine months, officials in the fitment and rate committees met thrice or four times a week to sort out differences between the Centre and states and present an acceptable proposal to the Council.Most of the state tax officers would camp at the national capital for the entire week during the meetings, before returning to their states over the weekend to look into issues there.The widespread deliberations of Central and state officials laid the groundwork for the new law's implementation.While Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia and CBEC chairperson Vanaja Sarna were at the forefront, Commissioner GST Upendra Gupta, Consultant in the Department of Revenue P K Mohanty, Joint Secretary (TRU) Alok Shukla, Chief Commissioner CBEC P K Jain, Commissioner CBEC Manish Sinha and many other Central officers ironed out numerous issues behind the scenes.Among state officials, sources said innovative ideas came in from Commissioner Commercial Tax (CCT) Karnataka Ritvik Pandey, CCT Gujarat P D Vaghela, CCT Maharashtra Rajiv Jalota, Additional Secretary CT Bihar Arun Mishra, and Anwar Khalid Additional Commissioner, West Bengal.All the state officers worked overtime to make the GST rates and rules as user-friendly as possible.Joint Secretary Revenue Udai Kumawat was the man behind drafting of the GST Constitutional Amendment law as well the compensation to states law.P K Dash (Director General-Training) manned the training academy preparing officers for the high-voltage reform which subsumes over 17 different taxes and transforms India into a unified tax market.Nearly 55,000 state and Central officers have been trained in the academy and in-house training programmes were organised at the Commissionerate level. E-training modules were also released.GST will reduce the cascading effect of taxes, decrease prices, create a common market that will not fuel inflation and make it easier to do business.The self-regulating tax system and non-intrusive electronic architecture would decrease black transactions, officials said.
The just effected Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime in India is positive for the country'scredit profile as it would increase government revenues through improved tax compliance, US ratings agency Moody's said on Sunday."It (GST) will support higher government revenue generation through improved tax compliance and administration. Both will be positive for India's credit profile, which is constrained by a relatively low revenue base," Moody's Investors Service Vice-President (Sovereign Risk Group) William Foster said in a statement."We expect improved tax compliance to be driven by: (1) incentivization of tax credits in a GST system; (2) greater ease of compliance through usage of a common, shared IT infrastructure between the central government and the states; and (3) a reduction in the overall cost of compliance from simplified tax rates, uniform across the country," he said."We expect the net impact of GST on government revenues to be positive," he added.Over the medium term, the American agency expects that the GST will contribute to productivity gains and a higher GDP growth by improving the ease of doing business, unifying the national market and boosting India's attractiveness as a foreign investment destination.GST, which came into effect from July 1, will replace 17 taxes and 23 central and state cesses into a single national tax. The movement of goods will become much simpler across the country and may become cheaper, replacing the current system, where a product is taxed multiple times and at different rates.At the state level, the taxes that GST will subsume include state cesses and surcharges, luxury tax, state VAT, purchase tax, central sales tax, taxes on advertisements, entertainment tax, all forms of entry tax, and taxes on lotteries and betting.Central taxes being replaced by the GST are service tax, special additional customs duties (SAD), additional Excise duties on goods of special importance, central excise, additional customs duties, excise on medicinal and toilet preparations), additional excise duties on textiles and textile products, and cesses and surcharges.There are four tax slabs of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent giving India's GST a multiple rate structure, unlike elsewhere, which could pose challenges in implementation. Besides, this destination tax has a dual jurisdiction system of both the Centre and the states, which could pose further hurdles to its smooth administration.
People belonging to agriculture and textile sectors of Haryana are up in arms against the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government as some categories under these sectors are now being taxed under the GST regime.While taxes have been introduced on organic composite and fabrics with levying of five per cent GST, increasing the tax rates for pesticides and tyres of the tractors up to 28 per cent, have raised eyebrows among the stakeholders from these categories.Criticising the move of the government, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) spokesperson Dharambir Malik told The Statesman that they would raise the issues at Kisan Mahapanchayat to be held at Lucknow on 31 July.“Introducing or increasing taxes on any article relating to agriculture is an anti-farmer move. The farmer is already reeling under the debt and committing suicide. With such moves, the situation will worsen further. One side, the government asks the farmers to promote organic farming, on the other hand it gifts organic composite with tax. It is dual standard,” Malik said.“We had already staged protest in Delhi against it and will also discuss the issue at Kisan Mahapanchayat where further strategy would be chalked out,” he added.BKU Haryana president Ratan Singh Mann said, “The situation of the farmer has been already pathetic as they are not getting an adequate price of crops and overburdened with loans. Introducing and increasing taxes in the agriculture sector will cost the farmers more for the crop production.”A farmer from Pabnawa village in Kaithal district, Ashok, said, “What a farmer gets in exchange of the crop production is still unjustified because the price of cost is lower than the expenditure occurred, while the peasant’s own labour is never counted, and now we have to pay more for pesticides. Instead of uplifting the farming community, the government is burdening us by forcing to spend more”.Speaking to The Statesman, president of Haryana’s textile hub Panipat’s Small Scale Industries, Rakesh Chugh said that introducing five per cent tax on cloths and other products would affect the small industry worth Rs 500 Crore in a day in Panipat alone.“So far there were no tax, but the introduction of five per cent GST will affect the industry adversely. There are nearly 30,000 small industries in Panipat alone with a turnover of more than Rs 500 Crore. Over five lakh livelihoods will be affected due to the decision,” he said.Haryana Vyapar Mandal’s Panipat president Roshan Lal Gupta said cloth is among the key needs in daily life and since independence it has been exempted from tax. “Bringing it under the GST, will affect both the buyer and the seller,” he said. Under the GST, five per cent tax will be levied on garments and apparel of up to Rs 1,000, beyond which they will be taxed at 12 per cent.
Hospitality and travel industry players expect teething issues to crop up at least in the first few months of GST implementation but are not unduly worried, expecting support from government.Travel services firms said the “sheer complexity” in GST compliance and the filings required at multiple levels will involve a substantial increase in effort and time.The hospitality players also want the government to put only hotel rooms with tariffs of Rs.10,000 per night and above in the top tax bracket of 28 per cent in the GST regime.“During the implementation phase, we are expecting issues to crop up, especially in the first three months, but we are not unduly worried about it as the government is expected to help us resolve them,” Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) President Dilip Datwani told PTI.Expressing similar views, OYO Rooms Founder and CEO Ritesh Agarwal said, “There may be challenges in compliance and implementation but over time, there will be more clarity and familiarity, enabling all stakeholders to adjust, adapt and adhere.”Being a large-scale reform, there may be some initial teething issues, he added.Commenting on the immediate issues faced by players in the travel industry, Thomas Cook India CFO and President – Commercial, Finance and Accounts, Debasis Nandy said, “It is the sheer complexity in the execution/compliance that we see significant challenges.”He said filing required at multiple levels would mean a substantial increase in effort and time.On the issue of lower tax rate for budget hotels, Agarwal said such a move would ensure that the industry's quality upgrade continues while delivering standardised accommodation to middle-class travellers.This will also save create new jobs which could have been impacted under higher tax-rates, he added.However, Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) Vice President Garish Oberoi said 28 per cent GST for hotel rooms with tariff of Rs 7,500 per night and above is very steep.He asked the government to keep 28 per cent tax only on rooms with tariff of Rs 10,000 per night and above.Travel services firm Thomas Cook India felt GST would result in only marginal increase in cost for the travel sector.“The GST for tour packages, both domestic and international, has seen a marginal increase from 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent, and as such we do not anticipate any impact to holiday demand,” Nandy said.The increase in cost for international and domestic air tickets is also marginal, he added.“As of now, there has been some reduction in taxes, the benefit of which would be passed on to the customer. However, the full impact of GST on all input cost is yet to be fully ascertained.“After waiting and learning from what happens to the input cost, we will be altering our prices in approximately a month's time,” National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) President Riyaaz Amlani said in an e-mailed response.
The tourism industry in Himachal Pradesh as well as the visitors seems to be at the receiving end after the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) which was implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi led NDA government on 1 July.The lack of clarity on taxes to be levied on the services and the variation in the rate of taxes, ranging from dhabas to small and medium to high-end hotels had left them all dissatisfied.“There have been varied rate of taxes on hotel bookings as well as services rendered to the guests in small and big business establishments in tourism sector,” Sanjay Sood, the president of Hotel and Restaurants Association, North India told The Statesman.The rate of GST at dhabas to small and medium to high-end hotels vary from 5 percent to 18 percent which is creating confusion among tourists.“The tourists are harried lot as the cost of eatable items as well other services is different at these places, making them feel cheated,” Sood said, adding it was difficult to explain to them the difference as the taxes on various services related to tourism sector are not publicized in better way.This is leading to confusion among hoteliers and tourists as dissatisfied customer means less business in future as the industry in the state is flourishing on word of mouth. “But such incidents would only make things worse for all,” he said.HP Tourism Development Corporation (HPTDC) chairman Harish Janartha also shared the concern of the hoteliers. “The GST rollout would have serious impact on tourism sector in the state,” Janartha told The Statesman, adding we will have to wait for 2-3 months to access the impact of GST on tourism activities in the state.So far, the HPTDC run hotels are witnessing 70-80 percent occupancy rate, however, the occupancy rate at this point of time is high due to advance bookings made by the visitors. “The GST would affect high-end hotels in Himachal Pradesh as they attract high rate of taxes while the small hotels would continue to receive tourists, owing low rate of taxes,” he said.It is worthwhile to mention here that Himachal Pradesh witnesses inflow of over 2 crore tourists and there have been consistent increase in visitors arrival in last one decade.The number of tourists visiting the state included the religious tourists who throng the famous temples and shrines round the year.
