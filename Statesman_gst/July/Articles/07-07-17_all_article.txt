President Pranab Mukherjee on Friday gave nod to an order pertaining to implementation of the Goods and Services Tax regime in Jammu and Kashmir, clearing decks for the state assembly for enacting a State GST law.Official sources said that the President cleared the order and sent it to Ministry of Home Affairs for further action.The PDP-BJP government had passed a resolution on Wednesday in the assembly after which the state cabinet under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti cleared a draft order for concurrence of the President.Jammu and Kashmir is the only state which is yet to implement the GST which was rolled out in rest of the country on July 1.The presidential order, which was concurred by state Governor N N Vohra, relates to the application of certain provisions of the Constitution of India through an order of the President issued under Article 370 that gives special status to the state.State's Finance Minister Haseeb Drabu had said yesterday that after the Presidential Order is received, the government will take it to the Assembly for enacting a SGST (state goods and services tax) bill.Drabu, during discussion in the assembly on Wednesday, said that the government was not required to bring the resolution but it did so to "get a sense of the House on the issue", a move termed by opposition National Conference and Congress as a "sham".This was the first time in the history of the Jammu and Kashmir assembly that a resolution, seeking a presidential order on a constitutional amendment, was discussed and passed.

Dismissing conjectures that education will become expensive under the Goods and Services Tax, the central government on Friday said services provided by an educational institution to students, faculty and staff were exempt under GST."Such reports that education will become expensive under GST are completely unsubstantiated. In fact, there is no change made in any subject relating to education in the GST era, except to reduce tax rate on certain items of education such as school bags," the Finance Ministry said here in a statement.Pre-school education and education up to higher secondary school or equivalent education as part of a curriculum for obtaining a qualification recognised by any law for the time being in force and approved vocational education courses, are exempt under GST.Some of the input services like transport and canteen provided by private players to educational institutions were subject to service tax in pre-GST era and the same is continued in the GST regime."Transportation of students, faculty and staff services provided to an educational institution (providing pre-school education and education up to higher secondary school or equivalent) are exempt from GST. Similarly, catering, including any mid-day meals scheme sponsored by the central government, state government or union territory, to an educational institution providing education up to higher secondary school or equivalent, are also exempt from GST," it said."Further, security or cleaning or housekeeping services performed in such educational institutions are also exempt from GST. Services relating to admission to, or conducting of examination by, such institutions, up to higher secondary, too are exempt from GST," it added.The Ministry said that education up to higher secondary school level does not attract GST on output services and also on most of the important input services.Further, services by charitable registered entities relating to advancement of educational programmes or skill development for abandoned, orphaned or homeless children, physically or mentally abused and traumatised persons, prisoners or persons over the age of 65 years residing in a rural area are also exempt from GST."Hence, there has been no change in taxability of educational and other services on account of GST," it said.
