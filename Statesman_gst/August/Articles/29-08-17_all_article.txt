They told me that the existing helpline numbers and centres are able to solve their doubts but not the problems they face,” he said.Sisodia said that the work for formation of committees was already underway and that the same would be completed in about a fortnight.He said that the GST committees were being made to have a two-way communication channel, and urged all Delhi traders to be a part of the committees and discuss their issues with an open mind.
