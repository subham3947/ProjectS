The estimated Rs 5500 crore capital good leasing sector growing at 15-20 per cent may get tapered due to high Goods and Services Tax (GST) along with few other issues.“The GST rate of 28 per cent is high for the leasing industry when compared to the earlier five to 15 per cent tax burden. Higher GST rates lead to requirement of higher working capital at any point of time. This results in increasing the cost of leasing an equipment,” Finance Industry Development Council director general Mahesh Thakkar said.“The government should actively consider not bracketing the capital goods in the same GST bracket as luxury goods and sin goods. A lower GST rate will help increasing share of leasing in gross capital formation,” he said.The share of leasing in gross domestic capital formation in India is less than two per cent whereas the global average is 10 per cent, he said.The same could also create hurdles for the foreign companies in India since they believe that leasing is the most preferred method of owing assets for operation, an NBFC official said.Apart from GST rates, there are other issues like input tax credit, penal interest/charges for delayed remittance of EMI and sale of repossessed assets which needs to be corrected.“Till now there is no response from the government on our representation,” he said.Both pointed out that the issue will have a severe impact on capital-starved SME players who will face major hardship due to this.Construction equipment, wagons, heavy machinery, car leasing among others are expected to face hurdles in new regime.Leasing in India is just three per cent of global volumes and if taxation issues are not addressed, this will effectively be a death blow to leasing even before it makes a comeback in India, a equipment company official said.
The Cabinet on Wednesday extended till March 31, 2027, the sunset clause under the Goods and Service Tax (GST) for the duty exemption scheme for industrial units in the north eastern states and the Himalayan states of Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh — a concession that is estimated at Rs 27,413 crore.“We have estimated budgetary support of Rs 27,413 crore for the said scheme. The northeast and Himalayan states were entitled to 10 year exemption from excise duty. The challenge was how to transform under GST law. There will be refund under direct benefit transfer mechanism. The sunset clause has been extended till March 31, 2027,” Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said while briefing media after the Cabinet meeting.The budgetary support will be extended for the period from July 1, 2017 till March 31, 2027 for such industrial units located in these states which availed the benefit of central excise exemption prior to coming into force of GST regime, he said.The minister said it is estimated that total number of 4,284 eligible units located in these states will be benefitted from the scheme.The government was implementing North East Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy (NEIIPP), 2007 for north eastern states including Sikkim and Package for Special Category States for Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh to promote industrialization.One of the benefits of the NEIIPP, 2007 and Package for Special Category States was excise duty exemption for first 10 years after commencement of commercial production.Upon repeal of the central excise duty laws, the government has decided to refund the central share of Central GST and Integrated GST to the affected eligible industrial units for the residual period in the states of north eastern region and Himalayan states.The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) will notify the scheme, including detailed operational guidelines for implementation of the scheme within six weeks, an official statement said.
