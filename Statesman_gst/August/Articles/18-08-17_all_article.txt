The central government on Thursday extended the due date for filing of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) return for taxpayers who want to avail the transitional input tax credit.As per the laid down rules, the GST for the month of July 2017 has to be paid by August 20, 2017, only after which the payment of full GST return through “Form 3B” can be filed. The deadline for filing the “Form 3B” has been extended till August 28, 2017.The development comes after concerns were raised about the non-availability of the “Form” for claim of the transitional input tax credit on the GSTN website.According to Ministry of Finance, the “Form” will be made available on the GSTN website from August 21, 2017.“In view of this, a small window of opportunity is being given to all the taxpayers… taxpayers who want to avail the transitional input tax credit should also calculate their tax liability after estimating the amount of transitional credit as per Form TRANS I,” the ministry said in a statement.“They have to make full settlement of the liability after adjusting the transitional input tax credit before 20th August, 2017. However, in such cases, they will get time up to 28th August, 2017 to submit Form TRANS I and Form 3B.”Besides, the ministry informed that any shortfall in the amount already paid vis-à-vis the “amount payable on submission of Form 3B” will have to be paid with interest at the rate of 18 per cent for the period between August 21 till the payment of such differential amount.Abhishek Jain, Tax Partner, EY said: “This benefit would be available only to those who will file TRAN 1 on or before August 28. This would provide a major cash flow relief to the industry.”
GST tax portal is likely to offer from Saturday forms to claim credit on sales made before the rollout of GST which the taxpayers have to file by August 28, a government official said today.As GST return forms did not have a column for claiming transitional input credit, the government yesterday gave some breather to such taxpayers by giving them an extra week till August 28 to file returns.These taxpayers will, however, have to pay taxes by August 20 on the portal of the GST Network (GSTN)- the IT infrastructure provider for the new indirect tax regime.While GSTR 3B is the form for filing GST return, TRANS I is the form in which the businesses will have to give the details of credit that they are claiming for payment of taxes before the rollout of GST.“The transitional form is almost ready and we are working to upload it by tomorrow so that businesses can start filing TRANS I,” a senior revenue department official said.Yesterday, the finance ministry had said the TRANS I form will be available on the GSTN website from August 21.Giving relaxation to the businesses that need to claim transitional input tax credit, the ministry yesterday allowed them to deposit taxes on the basis of self-assessment by August 20, but gave them one more week till August 28 to file return.The taxpayers who do not claim any transitional input tax credit will have to necessarily pay tax and file return in Form 3B before the due date of August 20.Over 71.30 lakh excise, service tax and VAT payers have migrated to the GSTN portal. Also, 15 lakh fresh registrations have happened on the portal.For an easy compliance, the GST Council has allowed businesses to initially file their returns on self-assessment basis in the first two months of the GST rollout.So, GST returns for July and August will be filed on GSTN portal by filling GSTR 3B form. Return filing commenced on August 5.
