Telangana Rashtra Samiti members created a ruckus in the Lok Sabha on Friday demanding Goods and Services Tax (GST) exemption for some of its state sponsored welfare schemes.The schemes include Mission Kakatiya, Mission Bhagiratha and low cost housing projects for the poor.The Telangana members ended their protest after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley assured them that he would bring the issue to the notice of the GST Council.Raising the matter in the Lower House TRS leader Jithender Reddy said that due to 18 per cent GST rate, some of the projects in the state have come to a standstill."Financial implication will hamper severely the projects. All these projects are for poor people and for public use. Due to 18 per cent GST the state government is facing additional financial burden," Reddy said."Our Chief Minister has also written to Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) and Finance Minister (Arun Jaitley) in this regard," he said.Responding to this, Jaitley said he would bring it to the notice of the GST Council.Mission Bhagiratha is a drinking water scheme, while Mission Kakatiya is a scheme for revival of tanks.
India is a long way off from the ideal GST structure and it may not get there anytime in the near future, says NITI Aayog Member Bibek Debroy, who favours three rates.While asserting that the move towards the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was a good one, Debroy says it would have been much better if it had lesser number of tax rates."My view — for which the government is slightly upset with me — is that we should not have been here (the current GST) but we should have been much closer to the ideal GST," Debroy told IANS in an interview."Once we are here, I am not very convinced that we will actually get there (the ideal GST)."Debroy said that ideally, there should be a single GST rate, but at present "depending on how you count it, you have seven rates"."Every economist would argue for one rate but no country in the world has that. But instead of seven rates, have three rates," he said.While the government's stand has been that the system would eventually move towards lesser number of GST rates, Debroy said it now seemed to be a difficult shift."My point is that we don't know what those rates would be. Let's assume they are 12, 18 and 24 per cent, which sound reasonable. Can you imagine the tax rate of a product currently at three per cent increasing to 12 per cent? Really tough," the leading economist told IANS.Gold and gold jewellery are currently taxed at three per cent under the GST regime.Debroy said that the experiences of other countries had shown that growth and revenue increases happened through increased efficiency when all products were included and there were a maximum of two or three tax rates."Therefore, when people say rate efficiency, it will happen, but not right now. In terms of revenue increases, probably not that much beyond the extension of the base, because many more people are brought into the net," he said.Debroy said that an ideal GST removes all indirect taxes, puts all items under its purview and has a single rate."Ideal GST is still a long way off. Most countries in the world that have moved towards the GST have taken more than 10 years to reach there — if they ever have reached there," he said.The NITI Aayog Member said that while there are statements floating around that 140-150 countries in the world have GST, but that's not really the case."What they have is VAT (Value Added Tax) without the service sector being integrated. Proper GST exists in not more than six to seven countries in the world.""And out of these six-seven countries, with the exception of Canada, all are unitary countries — that is, where the central government decides," he said.In a country like India, there can't be the central government unilaterally deciding on the rates and several other issues, he said."Automatically, we are therefore talking about the dual GST and about the GST council. Now, when you have the GST council with all of the states having different perceptions, even if you assure compensation for revenue losses, what you will have is a long way off from the ideal GST," he said."So you will have a lot of products outside the GST like electricity, petroleum products, liquor and tobacco… And depending on how you count it, you have seven rates, not a single one."Debroy said that a positive way to look at it is that there has been some movement on the issue and that waiting for the ideal GST would have taken 20 more years to generate a consensus."So on balance, even as a complicated thing, it's a very good thing that has happened. But it could have been better."
The GST Council is likely to lower tax rate on Saturday on job works making fabric to garments to 5 per cent and put in place a mechanism for online registration of goods above a certain value before they can be transported.The Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, will also review at its meeting the implementation of the new Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime since July 1 and may finalise a mechanism to operationalise anti-profiteering provision to protect consumer interest.Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) Chairperson Vanaja Sarna said movement of goods between states has smoothened with 25 out of 29 states abolishing checkposts.“About 25 states have removed those checkposts. So far, it has been going all right,” she told PTI here.This would further smoothen after e-way bill in GST that requires any goods more than Rs 50,000 in value to be pre- registered online before it can be moved is implemented.“As the e-way bill process for the whole of India gets panned out, we should be able to do something which will be better,” Sarna said.She, however, declined to comment on whether the threshold in e-way bill will be retained at Rs 50,000 amid demands from various quarters to raise it.Officials said rules for the e-way bill will be decided tomorrow. This GST provision requires any goods more than Rs 50,000 in value to be pre-registered online before it can be moved.As per the draft provision, GSTN would generate e-way bills that will be valid for 1-20 days, depending on distance to be travelled — one day for 100 km, 3 days (100 to less than 300 km), 5 days (300-less than 500 km) and 10 days (500- less than 1,000 km).The information technology platform for the e-way bill system is being developed by the National Informatics Centre.Earlier this week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said it would be mandatory for manufacturers to pass on benefits of reduction in taxes post GST to consumers.“What if input tax benefit is not transferred to consumers? …we are meeting a few days from now… In a short while, we are going to finalise the entire mechanism as far as anti-profiteering is concerned,” he had said in Parliament.The Council is also likely to tomorrow consider lowering of tax rates for job works for making garments to 5 per cent from 18 per cent, an official said.Currently, services by way of job works in relation to textile yarns — other than man-made fibre/filament — and textile fabrics attract 5 per cent GST. Other job works in relation to garments attract an 18 per cent levy.The official said the Council may look at streamlining it and bring all job works, including for making garments from fabric, under the 5 per cent slab.Apart from reviewing the rollout of the GST regime, the 19th meeting of the Council may tomorrow take a look at streamlining the anomalies raised by the industry over the past one month, said an official, who did not want to be named.It will be the first full-fledged meeting of the GST Council, also comprising representatives of all the 29 states, after the rollout of the new indirect tax reform on July 1.The Council had on July 17 discussed, via video conferencing, hiking cess on cigarettes as there was some anomaly in the rate fixed earlier.After the July 1 rollout, the textile sector had protested, demanding rollback of 5 per cent GST on fabrics.Jaitley, however, had ruled out cutting tax rates for the textiles sector, saying a zero per cent GST on fabrics will break the input tax credit chain for the domestic industry and make imported items cheaper.As per the rates decided by the Council, in the textiles category, silk and jute fibre have been exempted, while cotton and natural fibre and all kinds of yarns will be levied a 5 per cent GST. Man-made fibre and yarn will, however, attract an 18 per cent tax rate.All categories of fabric attract a 5 per cent rate. Man- made apparel up to Rs 1,000 will attract a 5 per cent tax and those above Rs 1,000 will attract 12 per cent.
