Once GST identification number (GSTIN) is inserted in the system, it would shows taxpayer details like legal name, status (active or cancelled), jurisdiction office.It would also show status of last 10 returns showing return type, financial year, tax period, date of filing and status whether GST filed or not filed. “We are constantly trying to make the processes on GST portal easier, enriching and more user friendly for the taxpayers. Towards this end, we have added a new feature in the Pre-login search facility on GST Portal,” said GSTN chief executive officer (CEO) Prakash Kumar.Under GST, the input tax credit (ITC) of a taxpayer gets confirmed on purchases from another registered taxpayer when that supplier files the return. Thus getting to know the return filing status of a taxpayer will be of great help to buyers.
