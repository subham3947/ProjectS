The 26th meeting of the council will be held through a video conference.The council is expected to take measures that will make compliance easier for small businesses and traders, which account for the majority of taxpayers, based on recommendations from a panel led by M. Vinod Kumar, GST chief commissioner for Karnataka.It is also expected to do away with the requirement of filing tax returns relating to purchases and a comprehensive return on all transactions. It will instead, retain only the summary return to be filed every month (GST return 3 B), the information on which will be complemented by invoices of sales uploaded. That would be sufficient to give the benefit of tax credit to buyers, whose transactions will be reflected in the sellers’ returns.Small and medium enterprises and traders account for a large number of jobs in India, especially in rural areas, and form a politically significant constituency, which the government does not want to antagonize when polls in eight states are scheduled for later this year and national polls early next year.According to data available with the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises, there are as many as 36 million such enterprises in the country, half of them in rural areas, employing over 80 million people and accounting for a third of manufacturing output.Businesses will be given a transition period of about six to seven months to migrate to the new return filing system, said the official cited earlier.Another proposal before the GST Council is to have separate deadlines for small and medium enterprises, or SMEs, and large businesses. With the current deadline of the 20th of every month for filing returns and paying taxes for sales in the previous month, the government is facing a delay of more than a fortnight in getting tax payments. The idea is to let large businesses pay taxes by the 7th or 8th every month and let SMEs continue with the current deadline.“This will enable early realization of tax revenue and reduce the load on the IT system,” a second person privy to the council’s discussions said on condition of anonymity.The federal body is also exploring whether large businesses could be asked to file taxes for sales in March by the end of the month so that the government could account for that revenue in the 2017-18 fiscal year itself. The council will also consider other changes of a technical nature.“It is now essential to focus on stabilizing GST by moving to simpler compliance processes and fewer ongoing changes,” said M.S. Mani, a partner at Deloitte India.It is also necessary for the council to announce a uniform date for the e-way bill, which is presently on hold, initially on inter-state movements and on movements within states thereafter, Mani said.The electronic permit for goods movement under GST should preferably have a higher threshold than the prescribed value of Rs50,000, he added.
Toyota, which is a joint venture between the Japanese auto major and Kirloskar group, said it remains committed to continuous efforts in developing alternate mobility technologies. Photo: MintNew Delhi: Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) has advocated for a calibrated taxation policy that encourages “technology agnostic approach” and urged the government to treat all technologies at equal footing to bring down vehicular pollution and boost the volume growth in the auto sector.Technology agnostic approach implies that a company is unbiased towards using any specific technologies to solve its business problems. The automaker’s comment comes against the backdrop of Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant asserting that there is no need for a policy for electric vehicles (EVs).The company, which is a joint venture between the Japanese auto major and Kirloskar group, said it remains committed to continuous efforts in developing alternate mobility technologies. “We wish that taxation policy is calibrated towards encouraging a technology agnostic approach which would reduce pollution, reduce India’s oil import bills and encourage volume growth in the auto sector both of mass market cars and luxury vehicles,” TKM vice chairman and whole-time director Shekar Viswanathan said in a statement.This will in turn lead to growth in employment where automobile sector is a big contributor, he added. Under the GST regime, hybrid vehicles have been put in the same category as big petrol and diesel luxury cars, attracting 28% rate with a cess of 15%. However, the GST on electric vehicles is lower at 12%. On the government’s decision of not having a separate policy for electric vehicles in the country, Viswanathan said the company understands the current stance of government towards promotion of mobility in the country.“Toyota will further drive its customer-friendly and eco-friendly approach to encourage the ecosystem for all technologies,” he added. The company would continue to focus on the action points to align with the government objectives of reducing oil imports and minimising pollution, Viswanathan said. He added that Toyota has always been in the forefront working on ever better mobility solutions to address rising levels of emission and fuel consumption not only globally, but also in India.“We will introduce appropriate products in consultation with all stakeholders. In line with Toyotaâ€™s Global Environmental Challenge 2050 to achieve zero CO2 emissions, we remain committed on our continuous efforts in developing alternate mobility technologies such as BEVs, HEVs, FCVs, etc, towards the conservation of our environment,” Viswanathan said.He further said the state level EV policies will have a key role to play as a concerted effort to achieve reduced emissions and fuel imports. “We also recognise that it is the customer who will drive the choice of technology that we will adopt based on his/her needs of travel distance, safety and total cost of ownership,” Viswanathan said.Last week, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant had said that there is no need for a policy for electric vehicles (EVs) as an action plan has been prepared. He, however, added that a final call on EV policy will be taken by the government.
