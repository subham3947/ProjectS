We will have to sit and work out the mechanics...legally and otherwise what does it mean when we classify this as a tax, what is the process, how do the mechanics work in a GST-like environment,” said Rajan Mathews, director general, COAI.Adjusted gross revenue (AGR) is the basis on which DoT calculates levies payable by operators and has been a bone of contention in the sector. The matter has been under litigation as operators argue that AGR should comprise only revenue from telecom services but DoT insists that AGR should include all revenue generated by an operator, including that from non-core operations. Telecom operators are liable to pay around 3-5% and 8% of the AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fees, respectively, to DoT.“Once you go to this particular methodology (treating the levies as tax) , only telecom associated revenue gets taxed. The original intent of the licence fee is that revenue from telecom gets taxed,” Mathews said.The industry lobby also believes that operators will be able to benefit from input tax credit if the proposal is accepted by the government.“Once it becomes a tax on the operator, he pays it in the first instance, but he can then also then offset for any other thing that other operators (or third parties) have charged him for,” Mathews said.Even if Trai accepts the proposal, it will have to be approved by DoT, finance ministry, the Union Cabinet and the GST Council.“There is one nation-one tax regime now, that is the GST. The finance ministry will find it difficult to accept such a proposal,” a telecom analyst said on the condition of anonymity.“We will have see the nuances of the proposal but if it means the levies become a part of the GST, it could result in lower revenues for the government because it will pay have to pay input tax credit to the operators,” a taxation analyst at a consulting firm said on the condition of anonymity.Meanwhile, Trai, as part of its recommendations on the proposed new telecom policy, has suggested the DoT quickly resolve issues related to gross revenue and adjusted gross revenue which are being litigated in various forums.“A review of gross revenue and adjusted gross revenue would assist in enhancing clarity and removing ambiguities,” Trai said in its recommendations made public on 2 February.Trai also said that there is a need to review the rates of levies paid by operators -- the licence fees and spectrum usage charges -- since access spectrum is now being assigned through auction, and telecommunication networks have become the underlying infrastructure for growth of the digital economy.Operators, facing stress on their revenue streams due to increased competition after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, have pitched for a cut in these levies.
According to the survey by property portal 99acres.com, most of the metros saw average property prices either dipping or remaining flat, while overall sales improved in a few markets. Photo: MintMumbai: With the real estate market beginning to adjust to various reforms like demonetisation, GST and RERA, most Indian metros witnessed recovery with sales improving, while property prices corrected or maintained status-quo, a survey said.According to the survey by property portal 99acres.com, most of the metros saw average property prices either dipping or remaining flat, while overall sales improved in a few markets.The sales volume witnessed growth in cities such as Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru on the back of price corrections.While Hyderabad and Kolkata saw rentals increasing by 4% each during the October-December 2017 quarter as compared to the same period in 2016, Bengaluru and Mumbai recorded 3% hike.The report said the inventory-heavy markets of Delhi NCR and Mumbai witnessed corrections in some popular housing pockets of Gurgaon, Noida and Navi Mumbai.“The real estate industry underwent some of the most radical reforms and avant-garde policy changes in 2017.Residential demand, sales and supply took a hit on the back of uncertainties surrounding RERA and GST.“While the first half of 2017 was testimony to plummeting numbers, the second half saw stakeholders in a contemplative mode,” 99acres.com chief business officer Narasimha Jayakumar said.He said the buyers waited for RERA to unfurl its full impact on property prices and builders were seen acclimatising to the new norms.“RERA transformed the market from uncertain to mended buyer confidence during the quarter. Enquiries and sales improved marginally across cities. The premium market also saw enhanced traction in cities such as Bengaluru and Pune, suggesting an impending revival. With improving clarity on GST, sales are expected to revive across categories and budget segments,” Jayakumar said.The report further pointed out that price growth remained restricted across metros with inventory-heavy markets of Delhi NCR and Mumbai witnessing corrections in some popular housing pockets.“Prices may further dip in luxury and ultra-luxury segments in 2018 because of low buyer appetite for such projects. Other categories are, however, unlikely to see any major correction in January-March 2018,” the report said.On the supply side, the report said the saleable supply in the primary market appears low on account of slow-paced registrations under RERA. “Fresh inventory levels may soar in the ensuing quarters owing to increased registrations and new launches on the back of clarity in the norms,” it said.
