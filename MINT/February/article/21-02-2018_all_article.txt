On expansion of its physical stores, he said, they already have 25 and will add 10 more by April.“Studios get us good traction as conversion rate is over 65%. We feel physical presence as one of the most effective way for brand building and most of the new stores will come in small towns like Indore where we just opened a studio,” Kesury said.According to him, the next level of studio expansion will mostly be through the franchisee route, after its success in Bengaluru. Talking about house brand expansion, he said early this week they launched Clouddio, offering mattresses, pillows and mattress protectors. The organized mattress market is worth around Rs6,000 crore and is growing at 38%, according to Kesury.The company’s house brands portfolio consists of nine brands in the furniture and modular segments and the entry into the mattress segment is in line with its strategy of expanding its own brand portfolio as this segment has higher margins, he said, adding he expects this portfolio to account for 15% of the revenue in the first year.Pepperfry is present in 500 cities with delivery services to 5,000 locations and has 0.5 million registered customers of which over 60% are repeat customers.
