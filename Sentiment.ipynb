    "in fact , the only scenes that do work are action scenes , which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid . \n",
    "in this film , serious means dull . \n",
    "the dialogue is warbling , and basically just repeats the same points over and over , no matter who is delivering them . \n",
    "the plot , which has potential , is wasted , again just being cliched after a while . \n",
