#GST effect ...Surat ... India's largest cloth market is shut for the past 2 days ..  strange how well the Govt has downplayed this news !!!
Dined with a leading businessman who's among @PMOIndia's top cheerleaders. He's convinced that multiple #GST slabs will dent competitiveness
#GST is great news for farmers.Tax rate on fertilisers reduced from 12% to 5%.Indian farmers will save Rs.1261 crores after GST.
Glad to know that central ministry has reviewed our request on reconsidering to reduce the #GST on wheel chair and similar equipments.
Much needed reform #GST gets rolling. Unnecessarily complicated. Many bumps ahead Hopefully we will eventually blunder into brilliance 
Disheartening 2 c d common people n our industry(Many films lik Ivan thandhiran)struggling alike.Hope d govt steps in 2 provide relief #GST
Already 22 states in India have abolished check posts after #GST.We should see a huge decrease in fuel wastage and goods transport time.
Excellent move by Govt to make sure consumers are informed old prices and new ones.must say they are closely monitoring everything. #GST
J&K opposition leaders can't accept #OneNationOneTax ideology of #GST because it weakens their argument that they're a 'seperate' entity!
We should cook food at home as GST implies even LPG rates are hiked What Shall we do now? #GSTForCommonMan #GST
