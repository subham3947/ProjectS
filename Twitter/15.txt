Traders hit the streets in Gujarat in protest against Goods and Services Tax 
So much for #MakeInIndia  ... After #GST  it's looking more and more like #TakeInIndia  and for businesses it's #BreakInIndia
A critical reform that will drive economic growth 
Surat textile industry strike against #GST enters third week. Talks fail with the government. 
If they r not going to vote out @BJP4India from Gujarat then this protest is meaningless & useless. Ur Vote should depict ur protest. #GST
