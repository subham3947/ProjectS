Victory for @narendramodi & India #GST Bill passed in J&K Assembly.Whole country under GST now. One Nation One Tax
I congratulate J&K Chief Minister Smt @MehboobaMufti for implementing #GST in the State of Jammu & Kashmir.
To implement #GST in Jammu & Kashmir against the wishes of the people, the allegedly PDP-led Govt. can cage entire populace to kill dissent.
