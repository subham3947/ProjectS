NEW DELHI: India’s services activity plunged to a four-year low in July because of the disruption caused by the goods and services tax ( GST ), a private survey showed, but industry is confident of a quick rebound as the new tax regime settles into place.This follows a manufacturing indicator plummeting to an eight-year low last month because of the same reason — GST, which was rolled out on July 1.The Nikkei India Services PMI Business Activity Index plunged from June’s eight-month high of 53.1 to 45.9 in July, its lowest level since September 2013, but confidence about the future tellingly touched an 11-month high.A reading above 50 on the index denotes expansion while a number less than the halfway mark is an indicator of contraction.“PMI data for July highlight a reversal in fortunes across India, with the economy going into reverse mode after seeing a pickup in growth momentum during June,” said Pollyanna De Lima , economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.The Reserve Bank announced a 25 basis point cut in the key interest rate on Wednesday to boost growth amid sluggish industrial activity and low inflation. The central bank sounded a cautionary note on growth on account of sluggish private investment and other factors, while retaining its forecast on economic expansion.“The 78th round of the Reserve Bank’s industrial outlook survey (IOS) revealed a waning of optimism in Q2 about demand conditions across parameters, and especially on capacity utilisation, profit margins and employment,” the central bank said in its policy announcement.“In its assessment of real activity, the MPC (monetary policy committee) noted that while the outlook for agriculture appears robust, underlying growth impulses in industry and services are weakening, given corporate deleveraging and the retrenchment of investment demand.”Data released earlier in the week showed a steeper fall in manufacturing PMI to an eight-year low in July due to GST-related adjustments in manufacturing.The Nikkei/IHS Markit composite Purchasing Managers’ Index, which measures both manufacturing and services activity, sank to 46 — its lowest reading since March 2009 — from June’s eightmonth high of 52.7.Recent official data has also not been too positive with core sector growth slowing to a 19-month low of 0.4% in June.Excepting finance and insurance, the other four sectors — consumer services, transport and storage, information and communication, and real estate and business services — reported a contraction in new business. Though firms expressed a lack of adequate knowledge regarding GST, they expect more clarity in the near term to lead to activity growth.Around one in four service providers foresee output growth in the year ahead, compared with only 1% of firms that forecast a reduction.As per the monthly survey, the overall level of sentiment climbed to an 11-month high and prospects are anticipated to improve amid hopes of more transparency regarding GST. There were also mentions that marketing campaigns will support activity growth.“Whereas many will question how deep an impact the GST will have on the economy in the near- and long-term, firms seem convinced that prospects will brighten as the new tax regime becomes clearer,” De Lima said.Services charges rose at the sharpest rate in almost four-and-a-half years in July in contrast with manufacturers, which offered discounts amid efforts to stimulate demand.The sharp drop in Services PMI seems transitory, in the run-up to GST. It is entirely possible that businesses and corporates may have decided to postpone consumption, seeking more clarity on GST rates and attendant norms for input tax credit. And the rather smooth transition to GST should boost economic activity going forward. In tandem, we also need a regular index of services output, to keep better tab on segmented data.
Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), India's biggest tractor maker, on Friday reported 11.75 per cent YoY fall in consolidated profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 768.3 crore for the June quarter.The company had reported adjusted profit after tax of Rs 870.60 crore in the same quarter last year.Excluding the GST impact, profit stood at Rs 862 crore for the quarter, company said in a BSE filing.The company reported one-time impact of Rs 144 crore due to GST.Revenue for the quarter rose 5.41 per cent to Rs 11,094 crore, compared with Rs 10,524.7 crore in the same quarter last year.Revenue for the quarter rose 5.41 per cent to Rs 11,094 crore, compared with Rs 10,524.7 crore in the same quarter last year.Ebitda margin for the quarter fell to 13.1 per cent from 14.2 per cent in the year-ago quarter.Industrial segment remains sluggish, which remains a cause of concern.The company said that it has improved its market share in tractors and small CV segments, while it saw a drop in market share in utility vehicle sales.Tractor volumes grew 13.2 per cent, while the domestic tractor market share highest ever at 45.8 per cent during the quarter, the company said.
Banks may be one of the unintended beneficiaries of GST As payment delays haunt Indian companies amid tax credit claims, bankers expect demand for working capital loans to surge. While this may not be sufficient enough to offset the slowdown in the project loans segment, it still gives banks an opportunity to lend instead of keeping cash idle with the central bank.Bankers believe delays in claiming input credits, which service providers can under GST, may lead to an abnormal increase in working capital requirements. Input tax credit allows a service provider to lower the tax it owes the government, by allowing it to claim a credit on what it has paid on inputs.“We saw some decline in drawdowns during the end of the quarter and demand from customer side was muted as businesses were still dealing with registration and implementation of GST,“ said Jairam Sridharan, the chief financial officer at Axis Bank .“We believe small businesses are still working out how GST will impact them; however a larger section of the organised sector has adopted GST and, in general, demand for loans should see an up ward trend in the medium term. There could also be an increased working capital requirement as the tax payment will need to be made every month before the return is filed.“ As per latest RBI data, credit growth in the banking system was 6.0 per cent in June, which is still below the pre-demonetisation levels.Credit growth in the economy contracted 1.7 per cent during April-July 2017, compared with a minuscule 0.2 per cent expansion in the corresponding period last year, as per data provided by Care Ratings. The low growth can be ascribed to lack invest ments, high NPAs coming in the way of banks' interest in lending and increased capital requirements, besides migration of companies to the debt market to raise funds.“There was a pickup in demand for certain products at the end of June, which helped certain retail lending products,“ said Paresh Sukthankar, the deputy managing director at HDFC Bank . “The initial feel was that till people have their systems ready , actual sales will be impacted and once all of this is incorporated into their system, there could be some increase in working capital. But I think we have to wait for at least 2-3 months to figure out the lasting impact of GST on working capital cycles of our corporates.“
Rakhi , the sacred thread that women tie on the wrist of their brothers on the day of Raksha Bandhan, will not attract the goods and services tax ( GST ) provided it’s the traditional cotton thread. However, gold and silver rakhis will be taxed 5%.The finance ministry has said puja samagri, including holy red thread ‘kalava’, would attract nil GST. Thus, rakhi, which is in the form of kalava, would be exempted.Any other rakhi would be classified as per its constituent materials and attract GST accordingly, it said. Thus, rakhis made of gold and silver would face 5% GST.Central Board of Excise and Customs made these clarifications in response to queries from industry and public in the form of frequently asked questions. It also clarified that sandesh , a popular Bengali sweet, would attract 5% GST whether it contains chocolate or not, clearing a confusion over tax treatment of sweets that contain other substances. The industry had sought clarification on tax rate on sweets containing chocolate, which attracts 28% GST.
