A company with Rs 100-crore credit in lieu of taxes paid in the past regime, risks losing it now under the goods and services tax GST ) reign simply because of the \'fat finger,\' as it is popularly called.With the August 28 (Monday) deadline looming for filing returns and ensuring GST compliance , corporates are a deeply concerned lot. The offline utility for GST TRAN 1 form — to be used to claim input tax credit for the pre-GST regime — was not available till Sunday, leaving just a day for filing returns and causing a weekend rush.In absence of the utility, details had to be filed online with higher chances of error. Tax practioners struggled to meet the deadline, having had to deploy additional manpower to manually key in invoices, some running into thousands.What has compounded the industry\'s worry is that there is no clarity on whether TRAN 1 can be revised later for any inadvertent human error (or fat finger) due to manual entry or will it simply mean losing tax credit.This has led to a clamour for another extension of the deadline or a provision allowing amending of the form later. The government had already extended the deadline once for those seeking to claim transitional credit from the past regime from August 20 to August 28, following industry representations.An offline utility allows entry of details, careful scrutiny and subsequent submission, reducing chances of errors while online filing may lead to fat finger errors.One company ET is aware of has already made errors in filing online and is worried about losing its accumulated input credit.Taxpayers are required to provide all details separately — invoice-wise or challan-wise. These can pertain to claim of Cenvat or value added tax credit on capital goods, details of stocks at job workers’ premises, concessional rate of central sales tax claimed under the previous regime and claims where invoices were not received till June 30.In some companies, these details would run into thousands of lines of items, where each line would need to be punched manually in the specified field in the online forms. Further, TRAN 1 (and consequently, all such details) is to be submitted for each jurisdiction where the entity has registration. Absence of the offline utility thus becomes a significant issue.The GSTN, an official said, is working overtime to ensure that all IT requirements with regard to compliance are met.The industry, however, has already demanded a tech audit of the GST Network. The Confederation of All India Traders last week asked the government to order a tech audit of GSTN in the wake of filing issues.Another official said the government is keeping a close watch on the situation.Tax experts are pitching for pushing forward the compliance calendar."Problems in filing TRAN 1 returns due to absence of (offline) utility is compounded by inadvertent errors made in filing, with no recourse or visibility of a change in the returns... The compliance calendar should be pushed forward to allow GSTN to be fully ready with its software," said Bipin Sapra, partner, EY."Without any utility on GSTN for filing TRAN 1, companies have to manually punch thousands of invoice and other details on the portal. It is both time-consuming and error-prone. Also, there is confusion as to whether TRAN 1 can be revised later (or not)," said Pratik Jain, indirect tax leader, PricewaterhouseCoopers.Jain said the industry would hope for an extension of the timeline for filing TRAN 1 once the utility is in place and an immediate clarification that it can be revised at least till September 30.MS Mani, senior director, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP, pointed out that service providers are equally hit. "Several businesses that had filed their service tax returns by August 15 and thereafter realised they are required to revise the service tax returns are now in a quandary.
Implementation of goods and services tax GST ) will have a positive impact on state governments’ finances in the medium to long term, according to a report by ratings firm India Ratings . Even in the short term, the impact on individual states varies across states, it said .GST, a process towards standardisation of taxes across the country, is being criticised for its near term impact on inflation and to some extent impacting states’ autonomy in deciding tax rates.Nine state-level taxes included in GST are: state value added tax, central sales tax, purchase tax, luxury tax, entry tax (all forms), entertainment tax (except those levied by local bodies), taxes on advertisements, taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling and state cesses and surcharges insofar as they relate to the supply of goods or services. However, taxes on income, property and capital transactions, petroleum products, state excise and electricity duty are not part of GST and states would continue to levy and collect these in the same manner as earlier.At an aggregate level, the state taxes that are subsumed in GST accounted for 55% of states’ own tax revenue and grew at 14.0% during FY12-FY17, the report said. This will be the rate at which if state taxes that are subsumed in GST grow in FY18 over FY16, then centre will not be required to compensate states for any revenue loss. However, there are wide variations across states, with subsumed GST taxes growing at just 8.47% for Punjab during FY12-FY17 but 39.70% for Telangana.GST revenues of all states combined will grow at a CAGR of 16.6% in FY18 over FY16, according to India Rating's calculations. However, since the picture at the individual state level differs, eight states namely Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab and Tamil Nadu would need compensation from the central government for any revenue loss under baseline scenario. This would cost INR56 billion to the central government in FY18.As post introduction of GST, input tax credit is available on both goods and services, Ind-Ra's calculation shows that the growth of GST component of states’ own tax revenue for all states in such a case would drop to 15.5% in FY18 (base line scenario 16.6%) and three more states namely, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand would require compensation from the central government. The total compensation amount therefore would increase to Rs 95 billion in FY18 (baseline scenario: Rs 56 billion). This is based on the assumption that in the final production of goods and services, service tax accounts for 10%.Like the state VAT which was rolled out from April 2005 to January 2008, implementation of GST will also bring in some efficiency gains. If we combine the 5% efficiency gain with 10% input tax credit on services tax, then only five states namely Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Odisha, Punjab and Tamil Nadu would need compensation from the central government and the total compensation amount would drop to Rs 37 billion in FY18.To be able to absorb the positive impact of GST on state finances, states will have to keep a constant vigil on the buoyancy of taxes that are outside the purview of GST as also their own non-tax revenue, India Ratings said.
