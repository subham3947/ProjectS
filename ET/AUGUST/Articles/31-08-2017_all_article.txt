FMCG major Nestle India expects its "registered sales" growth to be impacted till June next year on account of GST However, sales volume will not be impacted as much, the company said in a investors presentation."The expected registered sales would be lower. That is because the excise duty has been now subsumed in the GST so the sales line will take a number hit," said Nestle India CMD Suresh Narayanan.The company said the excise duty has got subsumed in the GST rate post July 1 and will be netted from the sales, which will be higher than the pre-GST regime."The domestic growth rate will be adversely impacted till June 18, till the time the base becomes comparable," said Nestle India Chief Financial Officer Shobinder Duggal In the pre GST regime , sales were registered gross of excise duty and excise duty used to be a separate cost line and the VAT which was paid on sales was netted from sales, the FMCG company said."What is going to happen when we go to post GST is that we all know the excise duty has got subsumed in the GST rate and GST like VAT will be netted from sales," he added.The range of the GST rates for each of the company's categories are between 5 per cent and 28 per cent for milk and nutrition products According to Duggal: "Volumes do not change, but value growth and to a certain extent, the real internal growth will also change especially for products which are being launched".Prepared dishes and cooking aids are taxed between 5 per cent to 18 per cent while chocolate and confectionery are between 18 per cent to 28 per cent in the GST regime.In the case of beverages GST rates ranges between 12 per cent to 28 per cent.Nestle India reported an increase of 9.66 per cent in net profit to Rs 263.43 crore for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017.The company, which follows January-December period as financial year, had posted 7.29 per cent increase in net sales to Rs 2,469.06 crore.
FMCG major HUL today said some pockets in wholesale trade and rural areas are yet to return to normal level after taking a hit from demonetisation and pre-GST destocking, and the sales in these areas are expected to pick up soon.A good monsoon and government\'s increased spending on rural areas will be major contributing factors in the growth of FMCG sector, it added."As far as FMCG is concerned, there has been a bit of turbulence first with the demonetisation and then with run-up to GST," Hindustan Unilever CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta told on the sidelines of the Economist Summit.He further said in the last two consecutive years, the sector has suffered due to drought and its impact. Rural markets, which have historically huge growth rates, had come down significantly due to the combined impact."We certainly believe that the markets would pick up...we are always optimistic about the medium to long-term FMCG prospects in the country," he said.Mehta further said: "I think the kind of steps the government is taking and also with good monsoon, certainly not in a very distant future, we should start seeing a pick-up in rural India."On the impact of GST implementation, he said: "What has gone disrupted is the supply chain because there were lot of wholesellers who had stopped buying before the GST came in."Similarly, he said some big customers have stopped buying and it had an adverse impact."But I believe that it should start easing up and it has eased up in many parts of the country, however there are still some pockets where things are a bit tough where the wholesale trade has still not gone back to the earlier rhythm of the buying patterns. It should be coming back," Mehta said.The company, which manufactures almost 97-98 per cent of its products in India, has almost completed its new unit in Assam and would be inaugurated soon.Besides, HUL\'s export figure stands at Rs 1,000 crore annually, he added.When asked if the company was looking to enhance its exports he said: "We are certainly looking at the options as how we could become a bigger manufacturing base for Unilever.
