Companies in FMCG and consumer durable space are facing a surprise bouncer from their dealers experiencing goods and services tax ( GST ) transition blues.Dealers have sought compensation from companies as they are unable to claim credit on the past stock and therefore, have to shell out extra tax from their pocket for now. This has raised their working capital costs.“There is a minor working capital cash shock for the dealers in the month,” said a source, adding that industry is still grappling with the fine print of this major tax reform.“There is a lot of fine print within the GST that is yet to be clarified. There is confusion in the trade on issues such as input credit which are still persisting. We are awaiting clarity on the same,” said an official with a leading FMCG company.Trade partners of most consumer goods and durables firms had destocked in the two weeks just ahead of the GST rollout to ensure they were not saddled with unsold or transition stocks. Those who did not are now facing this issue of input tax credit for this pre-GST stock.“As far as our company is concerned, we took necessary steps to start with a clean pipeline with the GST and made efforts to ensure that our distributors were not saddled with stocks,” said Parle Products marketing head Mayank Shah.Last month, Britannia had dragged distributors in Kerala to court, alleging ‘unfair trade practices’ to extract higher margins’ post the GST implementation. The problem has arisen as there is no clarity on ‘Form Tran-2’, which is to be filed by dealers to avail credit in lieu of tax paid on goods from pre-GST period. The GSTN does not have the utility needed for filing of this form.“The non-availability of input credit on opening inventory will have adverse impact on working capital. Prompt clarification will be helpful to avoid hardship,” Dabur India chief financial officer Lalit Malik said.As per the GST law, Tran-2 is required to be filed by an assessees wanting to take deemed credit on transition stock where no duty paying documents are available.This is mostly for dealers who get central excise duty paid goods, and have paid value added tax and would now want to claim credit for the taxes paid.The GST rules provide that Tran-2 has to be filed by end of the tax period. Though no clear date has been provided in a tweet it was mentioned earlier that Tran-2 has to be filed by 20th of next month. But, no formal notification has been issued so far.Rules specify that an entity can avail transition credit after it has paid due tax on the transition stock. This credit is available for sales made within six months of GST cut-off and can be set off against GST liability on the fresh stock.Since Tran-2 facility has still not been activated, a dealer would need to pay entire amount in cash leading to working capital impact. For example, a dealer on July 1 may have both pre-July and post July stock. He would get eligible for deemed credit of up to 60% of central GST on pre-GST stock. Dealer would now need to discharge his complete GST liability till August 25, but if the Tran-2 was available he could have availed the deemed credit to set off payment of GST on fresh stock. The government has clarified and extended the date of filing of Tran 1for companies till August 28.“Ideally, same treatment should be given to Tran-2 as the government has given to Tran-1.Industry should be allowed to take opening deemed credit after payment of GST and filing Tran-2 before August 25. If this is not done, the opening credit would be deferred by at least a month, as the next due date of payment would be September 20.This impacts the cash flows of many businesses, including retailers,” said Pratik Jain, indirect tax leader, PwC.Meanwhile, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a key traders’ body, has suggested the government to conduct a technology audit of GSTN portal and take all necessary steps to ensure that the portal works in a cohesive manner providing ease to traders in complying with their tax compliances timely.
Even though as a whole states' revenue may clip past at a CAGR of 16.6 per cent in FY18 over FY16 under the GST , 11 of them may need an additional Rs 9,500 crore compensation from the Centre this year, says a report."All states combined will grow at a CAGR of 16.6 per cent in FY18 over FY16 under the new goods and services tax regime, but since the picture at the individual state level differs, 11 states will need a Rs 9,500 crore Central support this financial year," India Ratings said in a note today.While large states like Andhra, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal, MP, Odisha, Punjab and Tamil Nadu would need compensation from the Centre for any revenue loss under baseline scenario worth Rs 5,600 crore in FY18 smaller states like Goa, Jammu & Kashmir and Jharkhand would need Rs 3,900 crore compensation, the agency said.This is needed as it expects the GST component of the states' own tax revenue for all the states to drop to 15.5 per cent in FY18 with a base line scenario 16.6 per cent as input tax credit is available on both goods and services under GST."The total compensation amount, therefore, would increase to Rs 9,500 crore in FY18 (baseline scenario Rs 5,600 crore). This is based on the assumption that in the final production of goods and services, service tax accounts for 10 per cent," it said.It noted that unlike the value added tax (VAT), which was rolled out from April 2005 to January 2008, implementation of GST will also bring in more efficiency gains in tax mop up."If we combine the 5 per cent efficiency gain with 10 per cent input tax credit on services tax, then only five states namely Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Odisha, Punjab and Tamil Nadu would need compensation from the Centre and total compensation amount would drop to Rs 3,700 crore in FY18," the agency said, adding it expects GST to have a positive impact on states' finances in the medium to long term.The nine state-level taxes included in GST are state VAT, central sales tax, purchase tax, luxury tax, entry tax (all forms), entertainment tax (except those levied by local bodies), taxes on advertisements, taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling and state cesses and surcharges in so far as they relate to the supply of goods or services.However, taxes on income, property and capital transactions, petroleum products, state excise and electricity duty are not part of the GST and the states can continue to levy and collect these in the same manner as earlier.At an aggregate level, state taxes that are subsumed in GST account for 55 per cent of states' own tax revenue and grew at 14 per cent during FY12-FY17."This is exactly the rate at which if state taxes that are subsumed in GST grow in FY18 over FY16, then centre will not be required to compensate states for any revenue loss. However, there are wide variations across states, with subsumed GST taxes growing at just 8.47 per cent for Punjab in FY12-FY17 but 39.70 per cent for Telangana," it noted.To be able to absorb the positive impact of GST on state finances, the report believes states will have to keep a constant vigil on the buoyancy of taxes that are outside the purview of GST as also their own non-tax revenues.
The goods and services tax in India will benefit the lower and lower-middle income class as it is likely to reduce the tax rate on goods, a blog posted on Asian Development Bank 's website said.It will mitigate significantly the negative impact of goods and services tax ( GST ) on the "bottom half" of the population, said the blogpost written by Mukul Asher, Professorial Fellow, Lew Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.In general, GST is likely to reduce the tax rate on goods as compared to previously, while tax rates on services are expected to increase, the blog said.As households progress towards higher income brackets, the share of household budget spent on services increases and on goods declines."So, the above overall trend would exhibit tendency towards lower burden for low and lower middle-income households, while the reverse is likely for upper middle income and high income households."This would significantly mitigate the negative impact of the GST on the bottom half of the population," reads the blog.It has been about six weeks since GST became operational on 1 July, and the impact on overall economy business, households and government organisations is expected to be multi-faceted, Ahser said.The impact will be felt by different sectors over differing period in a dynamic and non-linear pattern, he added.The blog said the impact of GST may vary as the household bundle of goods and services differs with income level, preference, age composition and others.He also said it is differential, not the absolute tax rate that matters to assess GST impact.Further, the timing of GST has been favourable from global and domestic perspective in minimising the impact of GST on cost of living."The design of the GST and government initiatives has also helped in this respect. The media and other stakeholders, and the households themselves need to also play a constructive role in adjusting to the GST," Asher said.A more service-oriented culture, backed by technology and professionalism by the GST tax authorities could help sustain the apparently small initial impact of the GST on the cost of living over a much longer period.
