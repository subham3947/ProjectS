NEW DELHI: The Cabinet may this week consider issuing an ordinance to increase the cess on mid- size, large cars and SUVs to 25 per cent from 15 per cent under the GST regime at present.The GST Council , the apex tax rate setting body under the Goods and Services Tax regime, had on August 5 approved raising cess on SUVs, mid-sized, large and luxury cars that had become cheaper post GST rollout on July 1.But, for raising the cess requires an amendment to the Schedule of section 8 of the GST (Compensation to a State) Act, 2017."The Cabinet will in next few days consider amending that through the issue of an ordinance," an official said.Views of ministries like road, transport and highways and heavy industries will be taken before hiking of the cess, the official added.An ordinance is issued when Parliament is not in session to approve a legislation or change in a legislation.The ordinance has to be replaced with a proper legislation with the approval of Parliament within six months of its issuance.Under GST, a cess was levied on demerit goods like cars, tobacco, and coal, to create a corpus for compensating states for any loss of revenue from their taxes like VAT being unified with central levies like excise duty and service tax in the GST.Cars attract the top tax rate of 28 per cent.On top of this, a cess of 1 to 15 per cent is levied for the creation of the state compensation corpus.The official said after the introduction of GST, the total tax incidence on motor vehicles (GST plus compensation cess) has come down when compared with the total tax incidence in the pre-GST regime.To rectify the anomaly, the GST Council, headed by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising of representatives of all states, had on August 5 recommended that the Central government move legislative amendments required for increasing the maximum ceiling of cess leviable on motor vehicles to 25 per cent from present 15 per cent.Once the law is amended, the GST Council will decide on the date when the increased cess will be applicable, the official said, adding the next meeting of the panel is scheduled to be held in Hyderabad on September 9.The highest pre-GST tax incidence on motor vehicles worked out to about 52-54.72 per cent, to which 2.5 per cent was added on account of Central Sales Tax , octroi etc.Against this, post-GST the total tax incidence came to 43 per cent.So, to take the tax incidence to pre-GST level, the highest compensation cess rate required is 25 per cent.Prices of most SUVs were cut between Rs 1.1 lakh and Rs 3 lakh following implementation of GST, which subsumed over a dozen central and state levies like excise duty, service tax, and VAT from July 1.Presently, large motor vehicles, SUVs, mid-segment cars, large cars, hybrid cars and hybrid motor vehicles attract a cess of 15 per cent on top of 28 per cent GST.Small petrol cars of less than 4 meters and 1,200 cc attract a cess of 1 per cent, while small diesel cars of less than 4 meters and 1,500 cc engine attract a cess of 3 per cent.
The newly created GST intelligence arm , Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence, has been named the regulator for dealing with money laundering cases in the gems and jewellery sector The Finance Ministry last week amended the Prevention of Money-Laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 to make the Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence ( DGGSTI ) as the regulator with respect to the gems and jewellery sector, said the notification.The regulator under PMLA issues guidelines and prescribes measures to establish client identity in different transactions.It may prescribe enhanced or simplified measures to verify the client\'s identity taking into consideration the type of client, business relationship, nature and value of transactions based on the overall money laundering and terrorist financing risks involved, the rules state.Under PMLA, every reporting entity is required to maintain record of all transactions of value exceeding Rs 10 lakh, all cross border wire transfers of more than Rs 5 lakh and all purchase and sale of immovable property of Rs 50 lakh or more.Rules provide for "client due diligence" by the reporting entity to prevent money laundering or terrorist financing. After the amendment, the DGGSTI would now keep a track of transactions in the gems and jewellery sector to see if they are conformity with law.Under the PMLA, \'Regulator\' is defined as an authority or a Government which is vested with the power to license, authorise, register, regulate or supervise the activity of reporting entities or the Director as may be notified by the Government for a specific reporting entity or a class of reporting entities or for a specific purpose.Experts said this is likely to give power to DGGSTI in the line with that of a Sales Tax officers to go to shops and check whether money laundering has happened.Nangia & Co Executive Director (Taxation) Neha Malhotra said through this amendment the DG GST Intelligence has been made PMLA regulator for the gems and jewellery sector."This sector has to ensure that they are compliant with the law, since now they are directly under the lens of DGGSTI who shall keep an eye on any money laundering activities in this sector," Malhotra said.The DG GSTI is the new name given to the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence (DGCEI), which was mandated to check service tax and central excise duty evasion.Ahead of the rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1, the government had strengthened DGSTI for detecting excise and service tax evasion using its intelligence network across the country. It also alerts field formations about the latest trends in the duty or tax evasion.During the last financial year, DGCEI detected tax evasion worth Rs 15,047 crore during financial year 2016-17.
