MUMBAI: India’s luxury-car market , which was bracing for double-digit growth, may hit a roadblock if the government implements the decision to raise the cess on large vehicles. In such a scenario, sales could even fall in 2017, industry executives said.After a dismal performance in 2016, when the market shrank, luxury-car manufacturers had become upbeat when India set levies on the segment under goods and services tax at a lower rate compared with the previous regime.They had immediately cut prices to pass on the benefit to consumers, who had responded positively, pushing up demand. But earlier this month, the GST Council decided to raise the cess charged on large cars and utility vehicles to 25% from 15%, taking the total tax incidence to 53% (28% GST plus 25% cess).The new rate is similar to the pre-GST levels for luxury vehicles and yet to take effect, but has still upset automakers who say they will have to increase prices if the government implements the decision.That may lead to a double-digit drop in sales, affect future investments and cause job losses, industry executives said.Rahil Ansari, director for the Audi brand in India, said the company had budgeted for double-digit growth, but now it may be the opposite.“I am not sure what the main factors behind the change in rates are … If the cess were to go up by 10%, then we expect a double digit decline in sales, probably around 20%,” said Ansari.The luxury car market posted a 2% decline in 2016 with sales of about 35,500 units. Many had felt the market to be closer to 40,000 units this year, with a series of new car launches and an improving sentiment.After the initial GST rates were announced, Mercedes-Benz , Audi and BMW had forecast double-digit growth.Mercedes-Benz’s sales in June and July had added to India managing director Roland Folger’s conviction that GST would infuse growth to the luxury segment.But now, the higher cess “has thrown a spanner to our planning and pricing strategy and it affects our long-term planning”, he said. “Luxury auto brands are now left scrambling for short-term measures, instead of planning confidently for future market growth.”Jaguar Land Rover’s sales in India had expanded in high double digits in April to June, but a higher cess could pull it down, said India head Rohit Suri.“We were looking at expanding our dealership, we were looking at local manufacturing of more products, because market was looking healthy and double-digit growth will spur us to get more products and have a positive business case.But now we are going back to the drawing board and questioning the business case. Now we cannot expand dealership, cannot hire more people,” Suri told ET.The proposed levy would raise the tax rate to pre-GST levels, true. But a fundamental cannon of taxation is the ability to pay principle, and it cannot be gainsaid that buyers of luxury cars would have the wherewithal for the additional cess. Besides, the effective tax rate should be lower with GST, as tax setoffs would be available along the value chain. Further, there would be much scope to rationalise the GST rates in a couple of years or so. And we need to extend GST to automotive fuels, so as to boost tax efficiency and avoid tax-ontax read cascading rates.
The deadline for first GST Return GSTR- 3B , has been extended (states are still coming up with Notifications) to August 28 from its original deadline of August 20. However, one must keep in mind that this is only for taxpayers who opt to use the opening balance of pre-GST credit in the current month. Those who do not wish to claim opening credit in the current month or those who have no credit; the deadline continues to be August 20.The extended deadline also allows the taxpayers to file form TRAN 1 by August 28, which is a pre requisite as per the strict interpretation of law to claim the opening credit.“Interestingly, TRAN 1 filing system is not up and running yet on GST portal . The industry raised the working capital issue as without filing TRAN 1 they could not have taken the benefit of the opening credit, resulting in adverse cash flow impact in the first month of GST implementation,” says KPMG India, Partner, Priyajit Ghosh.The other key points to note are as follows:a) The extended deadline would also help GST portal to ready itself for implementing TRAN 1 filing system.b) Considering the elaborate reporting requirements under TRAN 1, the window of 8 days appears to be far less for the tax payers.c) There is no clarity on revision of TRAN 1 and there would be interest implications in case of excess credit claim hence, most taxpayers would avoid hasty filing of TRAN 1, even after extension of timeline. It seems most have braced up for the adverse cash flow position already.However, businesses are unsure if the extension of eight days is enough. TRAN 1 is a fairly complex form and something that businesses have never dealt with. Input credit as a mechanism is also a new concept and it may take some time for businesses to come to grips with it.“It is a much awaited notification for the industry as it was not clear as to whether opening input credit can be claimed while filing GSTR 3B. Now, the businesses will be able to claim opening credit by filing TRAN 1 before 28th August, which is the revised due date for filing GSTR 3B. However, since GST has to be paid by August 20th, businesses will have to determine the opening credit beforehand. It is not clear, however, as to whether TRAN 1, once filed, can be revised later,” said PwC, Partner and Leader Indirect Tax, Pratik Jain in a statement.
The impending goods and services tax ( GST ) regime has made a dent on India Inc earnings for the April-June period, with profit growth falling to a five quarter low of 11 per cent, says a Morgan Stanley report.According to the global brokerage firm, GST, which was executed on July 1, adversely affected net profits growth for the first quarter of the current fiscal, with companies in the materials, consumer discretionary sharing bulk of the burden."Companies in the materials, consumer discretionary and consumer staple sectors reported impact (from GST execution)," the report said."Most of the impact was caused by channel destocking and dealer incentivisation which probably explains why both revenue growth and particular margin performance was weak in the quarter for these sectors," it added.Financials, utilities, technology and telecom sector companies did not report impact of GST on their earnings either in their earnings release or the management commentary.However, corporates\' revenues saw strong growth at 10 per cent, the highest in last 12 quarters, for April-June period of 2017, compared to same period year-ago."Broad market (1020 companies) revenue growth accelerated to 10 per cent year-on-year even as the net profit fell 11 per cent year-on-year," the report said.At the sector level, commodity linked sectors (energy, materials and utilities) and industrials reported the strongest revenue growth, while telecom, consumer discretionary saw the most decline in net profits.For an even broader sample of 2,629 companies, revenue rose 9 per cent and net profit growth fell 11 per cent year-on-year, it said.Further, Sensex companies saw revenue growth of 5 per cent and fall in net profit growth of 6 per cent, for the period under review.
