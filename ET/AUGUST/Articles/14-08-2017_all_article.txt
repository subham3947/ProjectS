In a chat with ET Now, Sanjeev Sanyal , Principal Eco Advisor, talks about the state of the Indian economy. Edited excerpts:I think a 7% growth rate is nothing to sniff at. Since credit is slow, some parts of the industrial economy have been slowing, private investment has been slow and we need to be aware about all these factors. But there are other positives of which we actually do not know the impact, like, the GST because we are not aware of the short-term impact it has had. I think the transition has been very smooth, perhaps smoother than we had anticipated but nevertheless we are not yet fully out of the woods as far as the impact is concerned. Similarly, I am told that the rains have been reasonably good this year. In this year, there is a lot of uncertainty because of these new reforms that we are imposing but we also have to take into account that there are all these deflationary effects and that is why this sort of uncertainty has been highlighted.There is the conventional wisdom that the farm loan waiver is a fiscal boost, suddenly farmers become presumably less indebted and therefore spend more. But it is not as if the fiscal constraints have been removed. The debt limits continue to be there. So what we are seeing is that the states that opt for this are making a trade off between doing something else, like less investment. What we have done is that we have done a survey of similar kinds of things over the past and even made some judgement about the present.I think the Finance Minister has made the point quite clearly, the chief economic advisor also has said this is not something new and we have discussed this in the Economic Survey in these lines.
