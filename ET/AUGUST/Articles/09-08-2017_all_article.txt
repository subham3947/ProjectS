The imposition of 12 per cent goods and services tax ( GST ) on desiccated coconut has hit production and exports, threatening thousands of jobs in the industry , traders and exporters said.They said the "high" GST rate was a setback to the industry at a time when both the domestic demand and exports of desiccated coconut have been rising.Desiccated coconut is widely used in the making of biscuits and cookies.Until now, desiccated coconut attracted taxes between 0 per cent and 5 per cent in the southern states, where it is mainly produced."There are around 80 desiccated coconut units in Tiptur in Karnataka (the largest cluster for the product in the country), employing thousands of people.Most of them have cut production by 30 per cent," said Anil Porwal , managing director at Mahavir Coconut Industries.Export demand for desiccated coconut has steadily risen over the last few years and it jumped a staggering six times to 20,000 tonnes in 2016-17. The value zoomed nearly eight times to around Rs 225 crore."We have become price competitive with other major sellers like the Philippines Indonesia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. As a result, the quantity exported has shown a huge increase," said Ganesh Vittal, partner of Vittal Agro Industries in Kasargod, the largest desiccated coconut exporter in India.Exporters are worried that the high GST rate will make Indian desiccated coconut uncompetitive in the global market "Merchant exporters like me have to buy from the mills to export," said N Srinivas, partner at PSS Varadarajan and Sons, a major exporter. "And now, I have to pay more to mills. The local price has gone up to Rs 150 from Rs 90 per kg".He added that the high price of Indonesian desiccated coconut had pushed up India's exports last year.Given the increased acceptance of Indian desiccated coconut, the Coconut Development Board has set an export target of 50,000 tonnes by 2020-21.
Veteran industrialist Adi Godrej today said the Goods and Services Tax (GST) will lead to considerable increase in the GDP in the next six months.At the same time Godrej acknowledged that there are certain teething problems under the new tax regime."This (GST) could add tremendously to our GDP growth. There are some teething problems here and there, I think they are being resolved."The government is taking a very refreshing approach to the GST introduction. I think it would be a great success and in the next six months or so, our GDP growth rate will rise quite considerably," Godrej said at the CII-India @75 event here.On the variable tax rates under GST, he said, "people expecting one single rate or two rates in a country like India with people with different levels of income is very unrealistic...I wouldn't call this GST a diluted form of GST introduction."In fact, it has been introduced as it was envisaged and a lot of care has gone in setting the rates at the right level. Many common consumption items, the tax rates are now lower than what they used to be, which will be very helpful."The Godrej Group Chairman further said free enterprise should be encouraged to accelerate growth."Private sector should be allowed to play its place and competition should control things... Let free enterprise take its course. It has built great economies all over the world. Free enterprise is what we should encourage, depend on and use to accelerate our economy," he said.Noting that there is a huge potential in the agricultural sector, he said value added production through processing could add considerably to the economic growth."If we could get to a productivity level in each of our major crops, which is equivalent to the best in India, we could double our agricultural output."Our scope is tremendous and we have to find ways where this can be done and find ways that we don't waste things. If we can have value added production through processing, the scope is tremendous and will add tremendously to our economic growth too," Godrej said.Asked about the future of jobs in an era where companies are looking at robotics and automation, Godrej said, "I don't think they should be too concerned about the future of jobs. I know there is a lot of talk about artificial intelligence, robotics (but) these sort of developments are very good for the economy."Observing that historically all the economic growth has always come from productivity increase, he said, "productivity increase leads to lower cost of production, leading to a higher consumption, leading to better growth. It leads to greater investments. Growth is what counts. If we can concentrate on growth and get good growth in India, our job flows will come reasonably well."However, he pointed out that there should be focus on education, skilling and training, for people to be employed."In many cases today, it is not that they people aren't able to get jobs. You are not able to fill jobs with the right kind of trained people," he said.
India is unlikely to allow the total tax incidence on midsized cars, large cars and SUVs to exceed 50%, which means imposing a cess of less than 25%.That should partially alleviate the fears of car makers, some of which have complained about an increase in the cess forcing them to raise prices after having just dropped them following the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) on July 1.The finance ministry is likely to move a cabinet note over the next two days for amending the GST compensation act to raise the cess on such vehicles to 25% from 15%. The actual increase, which has to be decided by the GST Council , is likely to be less to keep the overall tax incidence below 50%, a top official said. Automobile companies have protested against the proposed increase and many may roll back price cuts announced after GST lowered the effective tax.In the pre-GST regime, the effective tax on mid-sized sedans was around 47% and that for SUVs over 55%. “The cap is being raised to enable governments to raise tax rate as and when needed...“Increase will also not be effected at one go,” the official said, adding that the GST Council will take a final decision on the quantum of the increase.After GST was put in place, auto companies had cut prices of most large cars and SUVs by Rs 1.1 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. GST subsumed 17 central and state taxes including excise duty, service tax and value added tax and 23 cesses and provides for seamless flow of input tax credit. The amendment in the GST compensation act to increase cess can be carried out by an ordinance if legislation is not passed in the current monsoon session, which ends August 12.The GST rate on mid-sized cars, large cars and SUVs is 28% and with the cess — imposed to collect revenues for compensating states — swells to 43%. If the cess is raised to 25% from 15%, the total tax incidence would go up to 53%.As per the proposal, vehicles that fall under the tariff headings 8702 and 8703 including mid-segment, large cars, racing cars, SUVs and motor vehicles that can carry more than 10 persons, but less than 13 such as station wagons, will be impacted by the move.Also, hybrid vehicles with engine capacity of more than 1,500 cc and mid-segment hybrid cars of less than 1,500 cc fall in the category facing higher cess.The GST Council had on Saturday empowered the Centre to raise the cess to 25% from 15% for certain types of vehicles.The total tax on motor vehicles (GST plus compensation cess) has dropped from what it was before the levy was rolled out on July, the finance ministry had said on Monday in a statement.An increase in cess will help the government raise revenue to pay compensation to the states for any revenue loss due to GST, finance ministry had said.
Kerala Travel Mart (KTM) Society, a leading tourism body of Kerala, has expressed serious concern over high rates of taxation under the new GST regime, saying it would stifle the tourism business in the country by making it unsustainable and drive away the foreign tourists to destinations other than India."The high incidences of taxes will make India uncompetitive when it comes to tourism as international tourists will skip the country as a destination. There is almost a 19 per cent tax hike for an Indian product after the implementation of GST. The Centre should address the issue urgently,” said KTM president Abraham George.The industry has already been reeling under the impact of demonetisation and liquor ban on highways , he said, adding that implementation of GST has also started adversely impacting the business.In a memorandum to Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , KTM president appealed to the Centre to reduce the tax for hotels from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, substantially bring down the tax on houseboats and declare tax holiday for inbound travellers. In the pre-GST regime, hotels were charging 19 per cent tax on rooms.Making a strong case for rectification of tax anomalies, he said the tax has been to the tune of 38 per cent on tour packages for domestic travellers and 33 per cent for inbound international tourists clubbing the hotel tax with tour operators."The high tax of 28 per cent plus the tour operator’s tax of five per cent is costing a foreign traveller hotel tariff of 33 per cent whereas the average tax rate in foreign countries is between 7 per cent and 17 per cent,” George pointed out.A KTM delegation, led by Abaham George along with KV Thomas, MP, held discussions with Union Tourism minister Dr Mahesh Sharma, Tourism secretary Rashmi Sharma, the GST Council Chairperson and officials of the Union Finance Ministry and GST Council, drawing their attention to the serious anomalies
