Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya today took exception to Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao 's accusations that the Centre was taking unilateral decisions on GST , saying it was not proper to make false allegations.Expressing his disappointment on imposition of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on all the ongoing projects in the state, Rao had yesterday accused the Centre of taking "unilateral decisions" on GST.The Union Labour minister today said it was not proper to make false allegations and asserted that the Centre never resorts to unilateral decisions and it was wrong to blame the central government."The CM's accusation that central government is taking unilateral decisions on GST is not correct...GST comes under the federal structure and all the states are part of the GST Council. In fact, the states have more say than the Centre in the Council," he told reporters here.Rao had objected to the Centre's decision to reduce the tax rate on public works from 18 per cent to 12 per cent. He had "threatened" that the state government would engage in a "legal battle" against the union government over the issue.Even as the GST Council yesterday conceded the state government's demand partially and decided to reduce the tax from 18 per cent to 12 per cent on ongoing projects like irrigation, drinking water, road construction and housing schemes in Telangana, the state government sought reduction to 5 per cent.According to the minister, rates on construction materials like cement and steel have come down besides the interest rates offered by banks have also reduced."Hence, overall expenses on public works will also come down. The chief minister coming to a conclusion and blaming the Centre is not good," Dattatreya said.The minister added he will also study the matter before meeting Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on the issues raised by the Telangana government.On Opposition pushing some changes in the Constitution amendment bill on backward classes in Rajya Sabha recently, Dattatreya said the changes forced by the Congress exposed its "anti-backward mentality"."The Centre is committed to Constitutional amendment bill for backward classes and we will again get it passed in both the Houses of the Parliament," the senior BJP leader said, adding, their party will also conduct conventions in all districts of Telangana over the attitude of Congress.
The government is closely monitoring daily price variations in over two dozen essential commodities - from wheat to tea - to check at early stage any abnormal movement in rates post GST rollout, CBEC Chairperson Vanaja Sarna said.Prices have remained by-and-large under check post Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation on July 1 and there has been no big instance of supply disruption, the chairperson of the indirect tax body told PTI.The roll out of the biggest tax reform since Independence has been "relatively smooth" with multi-layer monitoring and officers of the tax department have been working overtime to weed out major bottlenecks in the implementation, she said.GST unified 17 different levies including central excise, service tax and VAT and there were apprehensions of initial hiccups."The Consumer Affairs Ministry is giving us the daily price, the price variations in common commodities. In that there was nothing untoward that has happened. For the past 30 days we get a report every single day," Sarna said.She said prices of about 25-30 of the most common goods, the food items used in every household - wheat, rice, pulses, sugar, tea - are being monitored by the ministry and it sends the daily reports to the revenue department and Cabinet Secretary office.Post the rollout, the Cabinet Secretary had formed teams of over 200 senior bureaucrats to monitor on a daily basis price and supply situation and ensure there are no disruptions.These officers were given about 3-4 districts to monitor and report to the Cabinet Secretary any issue with regard to either shortage of goods or unusual price rise or something to be concerned about.Asked if there have been reports of supply disruption, Sarna said there have been instances in some odd pockets, may be for a short while."Like a shortage of a good for a day or two. But nothing which should be worrisome. And for most of these, it is related to MRP change. May be for a day or two goods were not available because they had to give the revised price... There was nothing untoward that has happened," she said.The ministry of consumer affairs last month asked companies to display revised MRP, along with pre-GST printed sale price, to reflect the price change post the new tax regime. The old MRP will have to be clearly on display along with the revised MRP sticker till September 30.MRP or Maximum Retail Price , as per law, is the highest price that can be charged to a consumer after including all taxes. But in case of some commodities, the tax rate has changed post GST, altering the MRP.Sarna said so far the GST rollout has been relatively smooth."When you go into something which is so transformational, no doubt that you will have people coming up with many many issues but let me say that most of them were relatively small, containable," she added.
