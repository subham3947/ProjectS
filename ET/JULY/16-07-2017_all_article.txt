NEW DELHI: The government has clarified that there is no change in taxation of legal services in the GST era.“There are points being raised about the applicability of GST on legal services provided by advocates — whether it is in forward charge or reverse charge... It is clarified that legal service has been defined to mean any service provided in relation to advice, consultancy or assistance in any branch of law, in any manner and includes representational services before any court, tribunal or authority,” a finance ministry statement said.It referred to a notification issued under Central Tax Rate that states that services supplied by an individual advocate including a senior advocate by way of representational services before any court, tribunal or authority, directly or indirectly, to any business entity located in the taxable territory, including where contract for provision of such service has been entered through another advocate or a firm of advocates, or by a firm of advocates, by way of legal services, to a business entity.The words “by way of legal services” are preceded and succeeded by comma, it said.According to Advocate Shailesh Sheh, an expert on GST, "The legal services( including representational services)are taxable under GST regime but put under 'reverse charge' as recommended by GST Council. The liability to pay GST on such services is thus shifted to the business entity." The issue arose about the applicability of GST on legal services provided by advocates- whether it is in forward charge or reverse charge."Referring to the definition of ' 'legal services' that includes 'representational services' and Central governmentGovernment Notification, the Government has clarified that legal services which includes representational services provided by advocates , that is, an individual advocate including a senior advocate and a firm of advocates are liable for payment under reverse charge by the business entity. It is emphasised that there is no change made in taxation of legal services in the GST era.
NEW DELHI: Businesses can start uploading their sale and purchase invoices generated post July 1 on the GSTN portal from July 24, a top company official said today.The Goods and Services Tax has kicked in from July 1 and so far, the GST Network, the company handling the IT backbone for new tax regime, has been facilitating registration of businesses."We plan to launch the invoice upload utility on the portal on July 24 so that businesses can come forward and start uploading the invoices on a daily or weekly basis to avoid month-end rush," GSTN Chairman Navin Kumar told PTI.Generating invoices for dealings above Rs 200 and keeping invoice records in serial number even if maintained manually, are pre-requisites for claiming input tax credit under the GST regime.The GSTN had last month launched an offline Excel format for businesses to keep their invoice records and from July 24 this Excel sheet can be uploaded on the portal.Kumar said GSTN would put up a video on its portal to assist businesses in uploading invoices.Besides, a call centre help desk has been set up to assist taxpayers regarding any query they might have about the new tax regime."We have been reaching out to trade and industry associations telling them that those who have about 10,000 invoices a day, they should upload it on GSTN portal on a daily/weekly basis to avoid last moment rush," Kumar said.So far, over 69 lakh excise, VAT and Service Tax assessees have migrated to the GSTN portal and nearly five lakh new registrations have happened under GST.Under GST, which is a single tax in place of multiple central and state levies like excise, service tax and VAT, businesses are required to upload on GSTN portal invoices of their trade every month.Kumar had earlier said that the offline Excel tool can upload 19,000 invoices data on GSTN portal at one go and the process takes just half a minute.So, if businesses which generate about 10,000 invoices a day upload the data on a daily or weekly basis, it would be less cumbersome for them.While uploading invoice on the GSTN portal, a business would need to mention the invoice number and date, customer name, shipping and billing address, customer and taxpayer's GSTIN, place of supply and HSN code.Also, the taxable value and discounts and rates of CGST, SGST and IGST would have to be filled, along with item wise details like description, quantity and price.
