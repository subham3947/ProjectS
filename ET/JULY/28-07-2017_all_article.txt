MUMBAI|NEW DELHI: India’s goods and services tax ( GST ) has a found mention in the quarterly earnings calls and statements of global chiefs of nearly half a dozen consumer goods MNCs, as they cited the disruption caused by the transition to the new tax regime in a market whose profile has risen steadily within their global operations.The country accounts for 2-9% of the global sales of Unilever Colgate , GlaxoSmithKline, Coca-Cola Nestle and Reckitt Benckiser, and is potentially a highgrowth market for them.Some of these companies said the impact of the GST rollout weighed down their overall global performance, highlighting India’s importance as a key revenue generator.At the same time, most of them have welcomed the new unified tax structure, which they believe will prove to be beneficial in the medium term.“While we believe India has taken the right steps towards modernising its monetary and tax system, new policies have resulted in near-term uncertainty for retailers and consumers that impacted the beverage industry in the first half,” Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said on Wednesday during a call with investors, becoming the latest in a growing tribe of international chief executives to comment on GST.Analysts are not surprised by the attention that GST and Indian operations are attracting.“Indian business will be among the top five or ten markets for most global consumer companies in the long term. The contribution has been steadily increasing and is now contributing significantly to Asia-Pacific sales,” said Edelweiss Securities senior vice-president Abneesh Roy.In the run-up to the new tax regime on July 1, several consumer goods companies witnessed a slowdown in sales as distributors and wholesalers attempted to liquidate existing stock. After July 1, price cuts have been announced in categories where tax rates have been lowered. But, in some rural areas, where wholesalers have not upgraded their systems to be GST compliant, there have been supply disruptions. “In India, the welcome introduction of the new GST prompted distributors and wholesalers to cut back their stocks during the transition period,” Unilever’s global chief Paul Polman told investors last week. Unilever CFO Graeme Pitkethly said the company expects price growth to moderate as there would be less pressure on commodity costs and tax benefits of GST in India would be passed on to consumers.Hindustan Unilever, the Indian unit of the company, accounts for nearly 9% of its global sales and India is its second-largest market.Oral care major Colgate-Palmolive’s Asia Pacific sales declined 3.5% in the April-June quarter, primarily reflecting inventory reductions by wholesalers in India in anticipation of the new tax, increased competitive activity in Australia and consumption decline in Thailand. “We were just digging out of the demonetisation headwind and then boom you get the GST which basically saw the stock list close up sharp the last two weeks in June,” said Colgate’s global CEO Ian Cook. He added that the company was hopeful that there would be a “rebuild across the back half of the year”.Reckitt Benckiser Plc said GST’s impact on its full-year revenue could be £50 million, or about .`420 crore. “Volatility has been seen in India, particularly in the second quarter as many customers delayed their orders due to the implementation of GST,” Rakesh Kapoor , chief executive at the British consumer goods and healthcare maker, said. The maker of Dettol, however, added that there is no evidence that consumption had reduced and the market saw very strong sales in early July.British consumer goods and healthcare maker GSK Plc , too, said destocking on account of GST in India has impacted its global nutrition business in June quarter.

ET Intelligence Group: People who own shares of ITC can breathe easier now as the Kolkata-based tobacco-to-hospitality conglomerate's first quarter performance has met the street's expectations despite the markets recently shaving off 13% of its valuation on fear of significant GST impact.While the company's net sales dropped by nearly one percentage point in the quarter ended June, the cigarette and FMCG segments have managed to post improved performances in the past three quarters. Revenues from the cigarette business grew 7% -indicating value growth (on account of price increases taken in earlier quarters) and a flat to marginal decline in volumes.Sales from its FMCG business, contributing nearly one-fifth of ITC's overall revenues, grew 9% -best in the past three quarters -despite destocking by the trade ahead of the rollout of goods and services tax (GST). The segment swung to post marginal profit in the quarter after making loss a year ago.The company continues to invest in its brands with new categories like juices, chocolates and health & hygiene products increasing the investment budget. In a quarter wherein HUL's foods business posted a subdued show, ITC's foods business posted steady growth with most categories improving their market standing. However, the company's agri and paper business underperformed.Improved profitability is yet another aspect to cheer about in the Q1 show . There has been a 250 bps expansion in operating margins to 38% -largely pulled off by savings on raw material cost.It remains to be seen how ITC wriggles out of the current challenge facing its cash cow business to forge growth. The recent increase in cess rates effected by the GST Council is estimated to result in an incremental tax burden of over 20% on the company .When passed to the smokers, volumes growth of cigarettes is likely to be impacted.However, irrespective of the near-term hiccups in the business, ITC continues to be a musthave defensive stock in an investor's portfolio.Data from Bloomberg show that 73% of analysts tracking the stock have a buy recommendation on it.Despite the threat of heavy taxation, tobacco stocks globally are favoured for their rich and consistent cash flows earned out of selling an addictive product due to which they can pass on the incremental tax burden.However, ITC investors need to temper down their expectations of a strong growth on the top line front in the near term. A gradual recovery in revenue growth as the FMCG business gets ramped up is what is more likely.Meanwhile, consistently high profitability should provide the solace.
The management of Biocon represented by, CEO & Joint MD,in an exclusive conversation with ET Now spoke about the margin pressure and the expenses that came in the company's operations at the Malaysian facility. Edited excerpts:From a perspective of the quarter in terms of the margins, the reported margins were down to 81 crores compared to the same quarter last year which was 167 crores. This was impacted; one largely due to the fixed and operating costs from Malaysia coming into our P&L having capitalised the facility at the beginning of the quarter. We als, of course, had an impact from the destocking at the channel level due to the GST issue which impacted our India sales specifically.There was of course currency appreciation in the sense the rupee was stronger and since to the extent that a significant part of our revenues are dollar denominated including our research services segment this of course also contributed to a muted top line which then flowed through to the bottom line. There were multiple factors that went into impacting the bottom line.The other thing I would like to mention is that in the same quarter last year there was a onetime adjustment when we transitioned from the old accounting system IGAAP to Ind-AS.We actually correct for the onetime transition which happened at the beginning of the last fiscal then actually our revenues rather than declining 4% would show a 3% increase and our EBITDA rather than showing a 19% decrease would actually show just a 9% decrease and at the PAT level it would be decrease of 42% rather than 51%.Yes, what we have decided is that on an annualised basis approximately we have about $48 million of fixed cost coming into the P&L and it is roughly evened out every quarter for this fiscal.Now in order to recover in terms of to compensate or offset these costs through revenues in Malaysia we had guided that as and when initially we start receiving emerging market approvals in Malaysia, which might happen in the later part of this year, we should start seeing some recovery in terms of offsetting these Malaysia costs.We had also mentioned that unlike the developed markets the emerging market timelines are not always certain in terms of when an inspection or when an approval would come through. So to that extent there is some level of unpredictability in terms of the emerging market revenues kicking in but yes, we do expect the emerging market revenues to kick-in in the later part of this year.Yes, FY19 you would see a much better offsetting of the cost. In FY18 it would start offsetting overtime partially as you know that we have already offset some of the cost in Malaysia because we do have, for example, the three-year contract for our insulins with Malaysian government. We had already mentioned that this is a 300 million Ringgit contract so that continues at sort of an even pace every quarter and that is already beginning to partially offset some of the costs in Malaysia.We do believe that the impact of GST is something that I would say the entire sector faced in the month of June due to the channel destocking and we were also equally impacted where probably the volumes came down to close to half in that particular month. We will see a recovery of the GST impact; we expect the recovery to happen over this current quarter.So on a full year basis we expect things to balance out and even out and the GST impact will sort of not be material on a full year basis but in the short term, Q1 certainly there was a negative impact because in the month of June. In Q2 we expect to being recovery and we expect to see full recovery Q3, Q4.Sure, I mean a big milestone for us as you know this quarter was positive recommendation from the USFDA’s oncology drugs advisory committee for a proposed biosimilar trastuzumab which as you know we are partnered globally with Mylan.This recommendation was an enormous endorsement of our scientific, clinical and regulatory capabilities because number one it was the first biosimilar trastuzumab to reach the stage of an advisory committee recommendation for approval.Secondly the advisory committee recommended it unanimously it was a 16 to 0 vote in favour of recommending approval. Thirdly the recommendation went beyond the indication in which we had done the trial and they actually allowed extrapolation in terms of recommending approval to all eligible indications for which the reference product is approved, so it was a very significant milestone for Biocon and Mylan’s scientific clinical and regulatory capabilities.The committee approval is basically in approval to the---recommendation to the FDA, the FDA sets a what is called the target action date which in our case for trastuzumab is in September so between now and September we wait to see how the FDA progresses in terms of the approval. We are of course we meaning Mylan who has of course been responsible for the regulatory aspects in the US would be engage with the regulator in terms of the path to this September target action date for approval.The actual commercial opportunities pan out based on the certain timelines that have been set out as part of the global settlement that Mylan entered to with Roche the terms of that settlement are confidential but they would have, that settlement agreement provide some predictability in terms of the launch timelines which at this moment in time both Roche and Mylan have opted to be maintain confidentiality on that.In terms of the product pipeline clearly with our focus on biologics there is a very different horizon in terms gestation period for development. It does take a much longer time frame for developing biologics including biosimilars where may be a typical development cycle for ANDA may be two years or even less. For a biosimilar at least in the initial days it has been anywhere from six to eight years to develop these products.Even in terms of the investment for R&D we have always guided for example for a very high R&D numbers in terms of 12% to 14% in terms of gross R&D spends and this is largely because the cost of developing a biosimilar can range anywhere from $50 to $150 million per molecule whereas typically for ANDA it will be under $5 million per molecule so clearly the kind of scientific capabilities, the intensity of development both in terms of gestation periods and investments is quite different between the two businesses.
