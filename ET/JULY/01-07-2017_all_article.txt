MUMBAI: As India finally ends its 14-year wait for the Goods and Services Tax , ET spoke with various startups to find out how GST-ready is India’s internet ecosystem. Here’s a look at some of the system changes that have been made and the pre-GST rollout challenges that these companies are gearing up for:The ecommerce heavyweight has been prepping for the umbrella tax regime for well over 6 months and has launched a slew of programs and tools to help sellers on the platform understand the nuances of the new tax regime. “We launched an online A-Z GST guide viewed by sellers where they can undertake tutorials, training sessions, blogs and even professional support from third party service providers for efficient compliance,” said Gopal Pillai, Director and GM – Seller Services, Amazon India.With a 2 lakh plus seller strength, Amazon has hosted 16 GST campaigns over the past few months to enable face-to-face interactions with sellers to ensure seller awareness, on-boarding, product in-bound, registration, shipments, etc and has also been testing its systems on various use cases to ensure customer experience is seamless. The Seattle-based ecommerce player has also introduced the GST Rate Calculator to simplify the process of tax rate slabs for sellers and enable them to list different products under different slabs.While implementation doesn’t seem a huge concern for Amazon, Pillai says the notification on the e-way bill is an area where clarity is required. “The only concern remains with the e-way bill. The e-way bill in the current form has some restrictions when one undertakes industry delivery. In the GST era, it will make everything digitised. But there is no decision taken on that yet. We will continue to follow the current format until the government decides on that. Clarity on the e-way bill will further simplify the experience for sellers, operations and the customer experience too,” said Pillai.The online furniture rental marketplace has been ensuring steady communication to vendors and sellers and has been working with external GST expert agencies to understand the impact of the tax on its business. "The communication changes included explaining the concept of GST, changes in business for vendors, getting registrations done for vendors, notifying them about all timely changes such as the TCS deferment," explained Ambareesh Murty, CEO of Pepperfry.The company has also made changes to its enterprise resource planning system to get it GST-ready. “We changed our item masters because it was earlier based on Tax Collected at Source (TCS) and we now needed additional information being captured from all merchants. Their GSTN numbers would now be required so all those changes required technological implications,” said Murty.Murty however believes that it will be difficult to assess the impact of GST on the business immediately within its rollout. “Most businesses will still be trying to figure out the impact of the input credits they receive as the business rolls out over the next few months but before that happens, there’s no point in doing knee-jerk reactions like increasing or reducing prices,” he said.With over 4500 screens and over thousands of event partners on its platform, BookMyShow has been helping its vendors get GST-ready through an internal process. “We have helped our vendors through sessions and concalls to enable understanding. We are also helping them with registration formalities, understanding and completing the compliance work for them. We also have the responsibility of TCS (Tax Collected at Source) where we need to deduct 2% and then deposit it to the government so it is imperative for us to have all our vendors registered. Unless they are registered we will face trouble in collection of TCS,” explained Mitesh Shah, VP - Finance, BookMyShow.“We migrated to an ERP platform which is GST compliant and we have got modules tailor made for us under ERP, where vendor wise, state wise, whatever the CGST, SGST, IGST applicable, we are able to generate reports and give particulars to vendors in terms of overall transactions they have performed on our platform and the tax that has been levied on that,” Shah added.But the largest online entertainment ticket booking platform believes there are 2 areas where clarity is amiss which could deal a blow to the sector if not looked at soon. “Certain states have empowered local bodies to levy entertainment taxes since state entertainment tax is now being subsumed into GST. That leaves a big gap as to how will the local bodies use this and what sort of taxation will be applied on these over and above GST,” explained Shah.“Secondly, regional cinemas earlier enjoyed exemption under entertainment tax, for which they will now be able to claim a refund from the state government in the form of Direct Benefit Transfer. But those procedures and formalities need to be fully defined. Regional cinemas, being a large industry could see an impact of this clause, if clarity is not issued,” believes Shah.
The GST Council may have lowered the levy on economy class air tickets from 6% to 5% but airlines are demanding more, arguing that business and first class have got a better deal with input tax credit, or the deductions for taxes paid on various inputs.For an airline 'input' means goods (aircraft, spares) and services (catering, ground handling, aircraft leasing) that it buys to provide an output -air travel. Under the existing GST model for economy class, however, airlines can claim ITC only on their input services. So, the 18% tax paid on catering and the 5% paid on aircraft lease rental can be subtracted from the 5% GST on economy class fare, but not the basic customs duty and 5% GST paid on importing aircraft and spares. Since aviation turbine fuel (ATF), which accounts for about 40% of an airline's operating cost, has been excluded from GST, there is no tax credit on it either. Depending on the state they lift it from, airlines pay 4-30% sales tax on ATF.At present, airlines pay zero tax on import of aircraft and aircraft spares, but from July 1 the tax on an Airbus A320 worth $50 million will come to $2.5 million. For a Boeing 787, which costs about $130 million, the tax will be about $6.5 million, a senior airline official told TOI. Without full ITC on economy class, the low-cost carriers would be severely hit. The new taxes on aircraft imports come at a time when Indian carriers have placed orders for over 1,000 planes. Indian carriers earn about 86% of their revenue from economy class, said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at Ernst and Young.They might need to raise fares to cover their costs, added Anita Rastogi, part ner, indirect tax at PricewaterhouseCoopers.The government has, however, categorically said that the tax incidence on economy fares is not rising and even airlines seem to suggest that although the actual fare depends on demand and supply for tickets. “Currently , fares are high because of demand,“ explained an airline executive, adding that the tax impact will be marginal.In a letter sent to the finance minister , Alexandre de Juniac, director general of International Air Transport Association (IATA), said Indian carriers are concerned that ITC restrictions on economy class might favour foreign carriers that usually have more premium seats.Although the 12% GST rate on business class is higher than the existing service tax of 9%, airlines can claim full ITC on their premium seats, resulting in significant cost savings.Jain said, at the GST council meetings, the airline industry asked for withdrawal of customs duty and 5% GST on import of aircraft and spares if full ITC for economy class was not possible. Airlines are also worried about GST's impact on long-haul flights. For instance, going by the definition of `continuous journey' a passenger flying Delhi-New York on AI will pay 5% GST (for economy) on the full fare, whereas on a Delhi-Dubai-NewYork Emirates flight, the tax will apply to only the DelhiDubai leg, said Sudhakara Reddy , president, Air Passengers Association of India, a consumer rights body .
NEW DELHI: People planning to purchase white goods will have to shell out more money from today as most appliances and durable makers have increased their prices in the new tax regime under GST Durable makers would also go for another hike before the festive seasons as the industry is considering a price revision based on input credit, when their existing stock of raw materials and components would replenish."For our sector, the net tax would go up. The current tax rate is around 25-27 per cent and would go to 28 per cent. Therefore, immediately the consumer price, which is market operating price, would go up if brand and dealers want to retain the same margin," said Godrej Appliances Business Head and Executive Vice President Kamal Nandi Videocon COO C M Singh echoed similar views.Although trade partners and dealers have exhausted their stocks by showering discounts up to 50 per cent, makers still have finished and raw materials lying at warehouses and would take two-three months to avail the tax credit and bring it at pre-GST level."Once we start getting input credit from the freshly purchased raw material , which would happen down the line in two months, then we would have price at the same level as pre GST days," Singh said.Companies are getting their price list reviewed and from Monday onwards, dealers would start restocking based on GST prices."By Monday or Tuesday we expect price list of all brands to be out and then business would start. Our trade partners have already liquidated their stocks and would start buying," said Nandi.However, company as Panasonic would take a decision in this regard next week only."It would be not from tomorrow, hopefully we will review the need by early next week," said Panasonic India Director Sales and Service Ajay Seth.Moreover, the makers are not expecting a "huge spike" in sales in the beginning. "It would be a gradual offtake," said Nandi.Over price review before the festive season, Singh said: "This is bound to happen because people are waiting for a price correction as there has been an impact of 2-3 per cent because of GST...they have to do it in order to sustain."According to Nandi, the industry would go for a price correction again possibly in September, depending on the input tax credit and commodity price.Festive season starts from Dussehra and goes till Diwali and during that period durable makers account up to 35 per cent of their sales.
MUMBAI: Distributors of steel that constitute the secondary and tertiary levels of the steel supply chain are relieved with the GST rollout . However, challenges arising out of the changed method of taxation remain.The Goods and Services Tax that was finally implemented from July 1 after a special parliament session at 12 midnight, intends to bring a number of indirect taxes such as excise octroi etc under one umbrella tax.While most look at it as a half glass full, another section views it differently.Distributors of steel used to pay close to 18% in taxes with the imposition of 12.5% excise as well as 5% VAT.With GST coming in, the excise tax will be done away with. Distributors will have to pay Central GST (CGST) or State GST (SGST) of 9% each, depending on whether they supply within the state or outside the state."There is a net reduction in the taxes that we have to pay. However, we cannot decide on the pricing just yet. It will take us at least two days to arrive at a comprehensive pricing level," said Vishal Garg, CEO at Prachi Steel, an MSME that sources TMT rods, bars etc from SAIL, Vishakhapatnam Steel plant and JSW and supplies to builder lobbies as well as automobile manufacturers.The price of TMT rod has come down from Rs 27,500/MT to Rs 27,000/MT and is expected to go down further as the dealers will claim for input tax credits and gain from lower logistics cost which has been kept under the 5% bracket.However, smaller dealers in the supply chain still seem clueless about the changes in GST taxation compliance. While bigger manufacturers have had their accounting systems in place ahead of GST, the minor dealers who handle their accounts on their own, or take the assistance of chartered accountants, are still working on the changes their taxation methods will undergo."The number of taxes has not changed in essence. Earlier there was excise and VAT, now there is CGST and SGST. But the complications have definitely increased and we are working on them," said Bhumit Seth of Arihant Steel, another MSME that supplies to tyre and oil industries.
NEW DELHI: Prices of popular cars and motorcycles scooters come down from Saturday as the GST regime kicks in, even though hybrids and bigger bikes with engines above 350cc become dearer.The GST rates will bring in tax parity across the country and will lead to a regime of ‘one nation, one tax’, say auto makers. One of the biggest benefit will be flowing in for people living in Mumbai where the Octroi will be subsumed in the new GST rate.While companies will be announcing the new prices from Saturday, some will keep them a secret going up till Monday as they make changes to their internal software and pricing mechanims to factor in GST, which will also have an impact across the manufacturing and supply value-chain, including parts-providers and margins of dealers.“There will be no billing from dealerships on Saturday and Sunday and commercial transactions will not be carried out,” said Y S Guleria, senior VP, sales & marketing at Honda Motorcylce and Scooter India. “However, bookings will remain open.”Larger SUVs and sedans will see the maximum price cut while smaller cars will also be marginally cheaper. For example, the Mercedes GLS350 SUV will be cheaper by Rs 3 lakh, while Hyundai’s popular Creta is expected to see a drop between Rs 40,000 and Rs 60,000.On the other hand, small car Grand i10 will be cheaper by Rs 3,000 to Rs 14,000, the maximum cut happening in Mumbai for the diesel variant, officials said.“The final prices are still being worked out, but we have already assured customers that even if they buy in the pre-GST regime, the prices will be protected. Any change in prices, if it works in the customer’s favour, will be adequately taken care off,” a Hyundai official said. Maruti officials also said that prices will come down, but said that these are still being worked out. “There are different tax rates across various states currently, and the final calculations are being carried out now. We should be able to come out with the final prices by Saturday,” an official said.Toyota India said that price of the Fortuner SUV will come down by Rs 2.1 lakh on account of lower GST rates. On the other hand, the Innova multi-purpose will be cheaper by Rs 90,000. “We will be passing on the price benefit to the market. However, on the Camry hybrid, the price will go up,” N Raja, sales & marketing director at Toyota India, said.Prices of Hero Moto’s bikes and scooters are likely to go down by 5% to factor in the lower duty. Close competitor Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) will also cut prices, with the popular Activa scooter likely to get cheaper by Rs 3,400.However, bikes over 350cc will become expensive with models from companies such as Royal Enfield, Triumph, Harley-Davidson and Ducati getting dearer.
Niti Aayog member Bibek Debroy today said any suggestion that the Goods and Services Tax will boost GDP growth by 1-1.5 per cent is "utter rubbish", terming it as an "imperfect GST " following changes from the originally proposed "ideal" structure.The noted economist, however, quickly added that he will not "contradict" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia, when pointed out that they have been maintaining a similar boost to the GDP from the GST regime.Debroy also said the number of countries with GST is not more than six or seven, even as some "rubbish" figures of about 140-160 countries having GST are floating around.The Niti Aayog is a government think-tank mandated to advise on policy matters.Debroy said the Indian GST is not an "ideal" one because of the country's federal structure while a multiple rate structure was also a problem to the new tax."When you see figures floating around, there will be 1- 1.5 per cent increase in GDP after implementation of GST. For God's sake, that is utter rubbish," Debroy said while speaking at a session during the GST Conclave organised by a Hindi news channel."For an imperfect GST, I have no idea what is the figure. It might be even more, it might be less, but this particular figure (1.5 per cent) was for ideal GST," he said. "That figure was based on the model that the NCAER did in the course of the 13th Finance Commission report for an ideal GST. We are nowhere near that ideal GST, this is just the beginning of a process," Debroy said.The moderator pointed out to him that Jaitley and Adhia have also talked about such a boost to GDP from the GST, to which, Debroy said, "I won't contradict them.""That's rubbish. There are many countries in the world which have VAT, a VAT is not same as GST. VAT is the stepping stone towards GST."The number of countries in the world that have GST is not more than about 6-7 countries and if you look at these 6-7 countries that have a GST, except for one country (Canada), all the others are unitary countries," Debroy said. The eminent economist noted that the Indian GST is not ideal because of its federal structure."Should I tax items that are perceived to be elitist at higher rate, and should I tax items of mass consumption at lower rate? I personally think, as an economist, we should not do that," Debroy said."You do that through direct taxes and not through indirect taxes. There are other ways of addressing these issues," he added.Debroy pointed out that the moment you use indirect tax policies to achieve this purpose, you are automatically going to have multiple rates."And one of the problems, which we have with the present GST is the multiple rates," he said. Noting that no matter how good is intention of governments, there may be plenty of administrative GST glitches, Debroy said, "Hopefully, glitches will lead to tweaking of the GST law."Debroy said he would have preferred a single GST rate as multiple rates may create artificial barriers. Talking about impact of GST on inflation, he said prices of manufacturing products may come down and those of services may go up.
