NEW DELHI: GST Network , the technology platform for indirect taxes, has registered 76 lakh businesses and service providers with the total base expected to top the 80-lakh mark, which includes those paying central excise, service tax , state VAT, central sales tax and other levies.With 10 days left for registration of existing businesses, the government expects that it will be able to significantly expand the base, helping generate 20-25% rise in indirect tax collections, said sources.So far, 70 lakh existing taxpayers have enrolled, while six lakh new players have registered. A large number of businesses did not have to register as the threshold for GST was pegged at Rs 20 lakh, twice the level for VAT.There are, however, some companies which are in multiple businesses that can register each vertical se parately . For instance, a company which is in tobacco and hotels can seek two GST registration numbers.In addition, service providers -from Indian railways to banks, telecom and insurance companies -have to register separately for doing business in every state.Earlier, for service tax a nation-wide registration was sufficient. Some consultants are complaining that some of their clients have encountered difficulties during registration.“The response is very positive so far and our expecta tion of GST helping expand the tax base seems to be right,“ said an officer.A wider base augurs well for the government to generate more resources, especially during the last two years of its five-year term, besides making the economy less formal and less cashdriven. GSTN expects a rush for registration over the next few days as several businesses may want to register only now given that deadline for filing is nearing.Officers said that a large number of the businesses that have registered are likely to be small players although the data has not been analyzed.At the time when GSTN had registered over 60 lakh businesses, nearly 55 lakh were VAT payers, while 5.5 lakh were excise and service tax payers. Of these over 55 lakh were proprietorship firms. Around two lakh excise payers and 5.6 lakh service tax payers were also registered for paying VAT, which means that there was double counting. At least seven lakh existing taxpayers will now be part of the 70 lakh who have enrolled with GSTN only once.
Recent data showed retail inflation eased to a record in June and factory output growth slowed sharply in May, putting pressure on the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates. With the inflation numbers easing, the clamour for a rate cut is growing. RBI has maintained that it would wait and watch if inflation continues to hold the falling trend. Inflation has indeed been falling consistently.As per the Met department, monsoon would remain normal and that should help keep food inflation relatively benign. Till July 11, India received 260 mm of rainfall, a mere 1 per cent short of normal.In the last monetary policy review on June 7, RBI kept key interest rates unchanged, but lowered the statutory liquidity ratio by 50 basis points to 20 per cent. When RBI announces its policy on August 2, it is likely that the Governor will soften his tone.The central bank remains in wait and watch mode to see how the inflation trajectory evolves from July, following the impact of higher housing rent allowances to government employees, good pace of monsoon and the rollout of goods and services tax ( GST ). Besides, as stated in its minutes, RBI may closely watch the fiscal risks arising from state farm loan waivers.Though the recently released minutes showed that the business expectations index in the April round of the Industrial Outlook Survey reflected optimism in the manufacturing sector in Q2 of 2017-18 on the back of expectations of rising rural demand, exports and profit margins but in reality the manufacturing PMI moderated sequentially in May as employment contracted and new orders, both domestic and exports, slowed down. The business expectations index is generated by the central bank itself.The domestic equity market has rallied on expectation of a rate cut by RBI and other positive factors. Stock market players have already factored in a rate cut in the forthcoming monetary policy review. Be it market participants or industrialists, all are waiting for a rate reduction this time around.
