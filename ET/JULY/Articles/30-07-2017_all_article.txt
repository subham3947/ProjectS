NEW DELHI: Over 12 lakh businesses have applied for fresh registration under the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) regime, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia has said.Of these, while 10 lakh applications for registration have been approved, 2 lakh are still pending approval."The figure of new registrations approved in GST crosses 10 lakhs today. About 2 lakh applications pending in process," Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia tweeted.Businesses have time till July 30 to register under the GST.Also during the course of the year, if a business becomes liable to register under GST, it needs to apply for registration within 30 days from becoming liable for it.Although businesses with turnover of up to Rs 20 lakh are exempt from GST and hence registration is not mandatory, traders and manufacturers are getting themselves registered so that the input tax credit can be passed on in the supply chain.When a business registers under GST, it is given a provisional GSTIN . After that, in the second stage, the business has to log in to the GSTN portal and furnish details of its business including the main place of business, additional place, directors and bank account details.
NEW DELHI: New registrations under the goods & services tax ( GST ) crossed the 10 lakh mark on Saturday, a milestone that brings cheer to policymakers who have been hoping for an increase in the tax base after the rollout of the new tax measure."The figure of new registrations approved in GST crosses 10 lakhs today. About two lakh applications pending in process," revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia tweeted on Saturday. Increase in the tax base was one of key GST promises."Out of this 10-12 lakh, even if 8-9 lakh file returns there will be a substantial increase in revenues. It will also have benefits on the direct tax side and help check evasion," said N R Bhanumurthy, professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.Finance minister Arun Jaitley had said recently that if tax base expands, the government could consider lowering tax rates.The goods and services tax network (GSTN), the IT backbone of the new tax system, has also registered 86 lakh existing business and service providers. "Out of this 86 lakh, we have activated the GSTIN number for 71 lakh," GSTN CEO Prakash Kumar told TOI.The GSTN network operations have been smooth and adjusted well to the flow of applications. Several businesses which are below the threshold turnover of Rs 20 lakh are also registering to ensure that the input tax credit chain is maintained.GST registration is compulsory for businesses with over Rs 20 lakh annual turnover.The government expects that it will be able to significantly expand the tax base after the implementation of GST, with some estimates forecasting a 20-25% increase in indirect tax collections.ax experts said they would prefer to wait and watch to assess the increase in revenue collections as some businesses might have opted for multiple registrations."While the increase in the new registrations is a welcome sign, we will have to wait and watch whether the collections go up because that would indicate that new assessees have come into the fold," said M S Mani, senior director at consultancy firm Deloitte.
CHENNAI: The Goods and Services Tax was not an "easy reform to implement" but it has evoked "great" public support with the government deciding not to blink in the face of opposition to the new taxation measure, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said today."We have today reached a stage of history where there is a great amount of popular support behind reforms because people have become restless. They are not willing to be satisfied with a situation wherein India cannot reach up to its potential," he said here.Jaitley was in the city to address a GST Conclave organised by various industry bodies like CII and FICCI."I can say with a reasonable expectation for the future that it (GST) was not a very easy reform to implement. Occasionally, there are people who try and prevent any reform from happening," he said.Jaitely said he had learnt in the last few years that one should not blink if convinced that a reform was in the national interest."If you pause, blink, go into a reconsideration mode, then those who want to trip you will never allow those reforms to take place," he saidHowever, this time there was "great amount of public support" for the Goods and Services Tax as people have become "restless," he said.The finance minister said the pressure was on those who were blocking important legislations, disrupting parliament or when there was a time gap when the GST amendment was not allowed to be passed.Such 'public pressure' existed even on governments to continue to act and act correctly, and the popular opinion in the country was undergoing a "transformational change," he said."Therefore, let me say, that it is the people who have compelled this reform and brought the Centre and states together," he said.The finance minister said the Centre was aware of several issues being raised, adding that he was "conscious" of the difficulties, and therefore, constant interactions were happening on GST.Pitching the new taxation law as a key economic reform in post-independent India, Jaitley said, "Our next generation will be horrified with the idea of what originally our indirect tax system was.""Politically we became one, for all commercial and economic purposes we were not one," he said.Besides different Central taxes, states levied their own taxes and 17 such taxes had to be integrated into one and this brought in benefits like doing away with multiple taxation and ensuring free flow of goods across the country, saving on fuel, money and man hours, he said.Multiple returns, which often led to corruption, harassment and compliance burdens had also been done away with, he said, adding the country needed revenue to address important issues like procuring of arms and ammunitions for the army.Saying that the army required weapons in a modern warfare, he, however, wished a war did not take place.When concerns were raised by manufacturing-oriented states Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat over possible loss of revenue due to GST, the government has assured to compensate for them."However, when the earlier government had tried it, they had not assured the states of a compensation," he said in an apparent reference to the Congress-led UPA.Recalling the course of GST rollout, he said along with other states, Jammu and Kashmir also passed the legislation, in the face of separatists questioning the economic integration."The separatists started saying why should you economically integrate. But the consumer started saying if you did not integrate, I will not get the benefit of input credit and I have to pay tax twice over. So it was really an idealogical debate between the consumer and separatists," he said.Following the rollout of GST, the number of registrants originally paying taxes like VAT, Excise and Service Tax, which was around Rs 80 lakh, was growing and this gave the government a "slight comfort level," Jaitley said.And once this base starts expanding, it meant greater compliance and it was also an evidence that registration was a simple process, he said.Further, the government had started off with multiple slabs to prevent inflationary impact on products.Underlining the Narendra Modi-led government's push on reforms, Jaitley said in the last three years, the prime minister has been "forcing one or two important changes.""The changes really are that we create an environment which is business friendly in which your interface with government is the least, which is business friendly. We have eased the system," he said.Also, there was no discretions in allocation of spectrum or minerals, and these were being decided by market mechanisms, he said."If we today aspire to become a developed economy from a developing economy, if we continue to make changes and reform at this pace, we have the capacity to transform ourselves into a developed economy, improve the lives of our people and become a strong country," he added.For that, India has to become a country where it is easy to do business and a country where businesses are done in the most ethical manner, Jaitely said, adding each step of the government was guided and motivated by this consideration.Nobody realised how the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code would function when it was passed, he said, adding earlier those who took of rupees from banks and default on repaying them thought bankers could do nothing except have sleepless nights."The IBC has actually reversed this situation, that if you did that (default on payments), you have to exit and someone else has to control that business," Jaitley said.Earlier in the day, Jaitley, along with Minister of State for Commerce and Industry, Nirmala Sitharaman interacted with industrialists here.Later, he also visited the memorial of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa at the Marina Beach here and paid floral tributes.
NEW DELHI: Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley has lowered its inflation forecast for 2017 to 3.1 per cent from 3.6 per cent earlier citing relatively benign outcomes of GST and monsoon.It however said headline inflation troughed in June and the trajectory is still that of a gradual rise in headline inflation.Morgan Stanley Research has revised the headline CPI forecast for calender year 2017 to 3.1 per cent from 3.6 per cent earlier and for 2018 to 4.3 per cent from 4.6 per cent earlier.For the ongoing fiscal, it expects headline CPI at 3.2 per cent from (4 per cent earlier) and for 2018-19 to 4.3 per cent from 4.5 previously.Two factors led to the revision of forecast - first, the slippage in food inflation year-on-year has been more persistent and secondly, the impact of GST, rise in house rent allowance (HRA) and the ongoing monsoon on inflation was benign, it said."We expect that headline inflation troughed in June and that sequential rises in food inflation and the fading of high bases of comparison will mean that food and, by extension headline CPI inflation , will gradually increase from here," it said.Retail inflation hit a historically low level of 1.54 per cent in June on dip in prices of food items like vegetables, pulses and milk products.Regarding RBI's monetary policy stance, the report said recent slippage in inflation has opened up room for one more rate cut. "It is in this context that we expect RBI to take up one more rate cut at the August meeting," it said.Beyond the likely August rate cut, Morgan Stanley does not expect any further material easing of monetary policy in its base case.In its June monetary policy review, RBI left key rates unchanged with Governor Urjit Patel noting that the central bank wanted to be more sure that inflation will stay subdued.
NEW DELHI: To India’s automakers, the single producer tax appears to have given mixed signals. Ahead of its introduction, the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) had triggered what is called ‘pre-buying’ in June. After its midnight rollout on July 1, retail sales seem to have skidded somewhat, despite falling prices.Retail offtake has declined noticeably in July, senior industry executives told ET. Deliveries this month fell to a record low, ranging anywhere between 30 per cent and 50 per cent, depending on the manufacturer and the state of sale. Wholesale volumes, however, have grown strongly, as most dealerships had liquidated stock before the introduction of the single producer levy.“Retail sales have dropped this month as there was an advancement in purchases, driven by market offers announced in June. Wholesale dispatches last month, on the other hand, were postponed to prevent inventory devaluation to the extent of around 5 per cent. In July, the focus is more on wholesale as stocks were low across dealerships,” said RS Kalsi, executive director (sales & marketing), at Maruti Suzuki India.Automakers had announced hefty discounts last month to liquidate pre-GST stocks . The government had said it would not provide input tax credit for levies such as central sales tax, infra cess, and national calamity contingent duty on such inventory. The loss on non-credit of tax (CST, NCCD, infra cess) amounts to anywhere between 3 per cent and 7 per cent of the cost of a vehicle, according to experts.All carmakers subsequently revised vehicle prices downward from July after GST. The decline was 2-3 per cent on an average in case of smaller cars, and up to 10 per cent in case of bigger, luxury vehicles. Interestingly, the price cuts did not spur purchases.Roland Folger, managing director at Mercedes Benz India, explained: “The hiccups are not driven by our side of the business. We are very clear with our pricing, we have announced it appropriately. But what we see at the moment is that the business of our customers is affected. Everybody is sorting themselves out. They want to gain a better understanding of what GST will mean for their individual businesses. Once they have a feeling of that, we will see some increase in business as well.”Rakesh Srivastava, director (sales and marketing), Hyundai Motor India, said that GST has disrupted sales, especially purchase decisions of small businessmen and traders. This segment is estimated to contribute 25-30 per cent of sales in the domestic industry. To be sure, most experts consider the decline a temporary problem.Kalsi said, “(Retail demand in) August should be better… There are a lot of positives, monsoons have been good, GST has led to a reduction in prices… We are optimistic the momentum will pick-up over the next two quarters.” Maruti Suzuki is confident of meeting its target of double-digit growth in the current fiscal year.
NEW DELHI: With just about one lakh of 70 lakh businesses opting for GST Composition Scheme , tax authorities are reviewing why the scheme that allowed such entities to pay a fixed 1-5 per cent tax, has not clicked.A senior government official said the Central Board of Excise and Customs ( CBEC ) is trying to ascertain the reasons for businesses not opting for the Composition Scheme that was especially designed to ease compliance burden of small traders.It plans to step up media outreach programme to popularise the scheme.The composition scheme is an alternative method of levy of tax designed for small taxpayers whose turnover is up to Rs 75 lakh (Rs 50 lakh in case of eight north-eastern states and the hilly state of Himachal Pradesh). The objective behind it is to bring simplicity and reduce the compliance cost for small taxpayers.The scheme is optional wherein manufacturers, other than those of ice cream, pan masala and tobacco products, have to pay a 2 per cent tax on their annual turnover. The tax rate is 5 per cent for restaurant services and one per cent for traders."Out of the assessee base of 70 lakh, one lakh is very small number. One reason could be that the composition scheme cannot be availed by businesses engaged in inter-state trade. We are looking at it," the official told PTI. GST Network - the IT backbone of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, had in first week of July asked over 70 lakh excise, service tax and VAT assessees who have migrated to the new indirect tax regime to log in to their account and opt for composition scheme latest by July 21.The government later extended the deadline till August 16.Besides, there are over 10 lakh new assessees who have got registered for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) which has kicked in from July 1."We will increase our outreach programme to tell businesses about the benefits of composition scheme," the official said.Asked if some more relaxation is on the cards for businesses opting for composition scheme, the official said "the composition scheme is provided in the GST Act. So, we will have to see what can be done".As per the Central GST Act, businesses are eligible to opt for composition scheme if a person is not engaged in making any inter-state outward supplies of goods and he is not engaged in making any supply of goods through an electronic commerce operator who is required to collect tax at source.While a regular taxpayer has to pay taxes on a monthly basis, a composition supplier is required to file only one return and pay taxes on a quarterly basis.Also a composition taxpayer is not required to keep detailed records which a normal taxpayer is required to maintain.Experts said that lacklustre response to the composition scheme is because they are required to pay reduced rate of tax on entire supply which includes taxable supply as well as exempt supply."This payment of tax on exempt supplies seems to be punitive provision and seems to be against the basic intention of law," said Rajat Mohan, Partner, AMRG & Associates.Also, since a composition supplier cannot make any supply on a portal of an e-commerce operator, this provision has shoved away a chunk of small businesses from composition scheme."I believe the government needs to pin these issues in the heart before the problems gets escalated and small businesses feel the heat of high tax compliance environment or start losing customers to competition," Mohan said.
