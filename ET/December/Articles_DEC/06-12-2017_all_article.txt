NEW DELHI: Prices at McDonald’s (in the north and east), Burger King Domino’s and KFC have risen in the past week — at least on some of the costlier items on the menu — despite a cut in goods and services tax (GST) on restaurants because input tax credit is no longer available to them. On the other hand, the quick service restaurant (QSR) chains said some items are now cheaper thanks to the tax reduction. The GST Council slashed rates to 5% from 18% for restaurants with effect from November 15.Increases at McDonald’s (north and east), Burger King, Pizza Hut, Domino’s range from 5% to 8%, while KFC said the rise in price was marginal. This comes as the government has been pushing companies to pass on the benefit of the mid-November GST cuts on various items to lower prices for consumers.Connaught Plaza Restaurants Ltd (CPRL) managing director Vikram Bakshi said, “The actual impact of non-availability of input taxes after reduction of GST to 5% from 18% was about 8%.” CPRL continues to operate McDonald’s stores in the north and east despite the US chain announcing the termination of its franchisee pact for 169 stores in the region in August.“After careful deliberation, CPRL has increased prices, effective December 1, to give us an overall 5% increase,” Bakshi said, adding that the breakfast menu and all beverages are unchanged as are items such as the Pizza McPuff.Domino’s has raised prices of cakes, garlic bread and some highend pizzas by up to 8% but kept regular pizzas unchanged.“Since denial of input tax credit has led to an increase in the input cost, we have adjusted prices of a few items to only partially cover this increased cost. However, our customers will now witness a significant reduction in effective prices immediately,” a Jubilant FoodWorks spokesperson said.The spokesperson said Pizza Mania prices have been cut to Rs 62 from Rs 69, while the basic Margherita is down to Rs 104 from Rs 117. Under its Everyday Value Offer, pizza prices have been reduced to Rs 209 from Rs 235.KFC has raised the price of some items and cut that of others. KFC India managing director Rahul Shinde said, “Our menu prices have been updated to be inclusive of GST, and going forward our consumers will pay exactly what they see on the menu board.”A spokesperson for Hardcastle Restaurants, which operates McDonald’s outlets in the west and south, said there had been no increase in prices over the past week. “The government has brought down GST from 18% to 5%, but there has been a removal of input tax credit due to which our operating costs have gone up. We have passed on benefits to consumers wherever we could,” said a Hardcastle spokesperson, adding that it has “‘substantially reduced prices” of flagship products including the Maharaja Mac and spicy chicken and paneer wraps.“Depending on the category of the restaurant, price adjustment exercise to the base menu price had to be done to rationalise the removal of ITC,” said Rahul Singh, president of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI), which represents thousands of outlets. “We welcome reduction in GST slab from a very high 18% to 5% without any distinction of the air-conditioning. However, denying the ITC benefit goes against the grain of GST and will push up the costs by 10%, which will be passed on the menu price. So, effectively the consumer pocket will get a marginal benefit and not as it seems.”A Tata Starbucks spokesperson said, “Like many businesses operating in India, Tata Starbucks adjusted prices following the recent revision of the GST structure. The GST revision included the elimination of the input tax credit, increasing costs for the industry. As a result, we raised our base prices, while still providing savings for our customers after tax on every product.”The chief executive of a large global restaurant chain’s India unit said, “While there is a decrease in prices of some value products, the absence of input tax credit (ITC) has led us to take selective price hikes.” He said it was not possible to pass on all of the tax benefit. “For some popular products, we have maintained prices so that it doesn't impact consumer sales.”Burger King and Pizza Hut didn’t respond to queries.At last month’s GST Council meeting, the rate was slashed to 5% from 18% for all standalone restaurants, irrespective of whether they were air-conditioned or otherwise, without input tax credit. Takeaways and deliveries were also brought down to a flat slab of 5%. The change took effect November 15.
Talking to ET Now , says the business model is asset light and they do not believe in owning the warehouses or owning the trucks unless and until required.Edited excerpts :Yes, it is interesting times and different people, different companies within this third party logistics have probably different business models. Ours is focussed predominantly on the consumption sector firstly and what we have done over a decade or so is that we have created domain expertise around the consumption sector. We have believed in deploying the best-in-class technologies to manage scale and bring in efficiencies.So, by and large, what really distinguishes us is how we are able to provide value to our customers and in terms of business model, largely we are into contract logistics, third party logistics which is where some of these efficiency models come into play.Our third party business or the external business actually spans across the whole consumption sector. We have fairly reputed customers across FMCG, food, fashion, furniture, electronics etc. and the whole business model which we have whether it is for external or for the anchor is largely asset light and we do not believe in owning the warehouses or owning the trucks unless and until required. So, the model is asset light.However, capacities do need to be created but that is more in the form of warehousing space which you end up creating. The warehousing space is where we operate from. They are not really off-the-shelf warehouses. They are custom built. They are world class warehouses which are built according to the specifications we give to the local developers.I am bound by RHP and I really cannot give futuristic projections but if you look at the last few years, the growth has been good. The first half of this month again has been quite aggressive.If you look at whatever has been happening around us, it may be put into two buckets; one within the consumption domain with a lot of our customers, lot of product companies, mid-sized, large-sized enterprises are going through this change in philosophy at their end slowly but surely. There is this whole concept around core competencies and what they should be managing internally.Some of this evolution has been on the IT side for instance, and we believe that is a change which is happening slowly but very surely wherein people are realising that supply chain is a strategic aspect of their business.That is one. The other is a more important change which is around the GST . It has been one of the game changers, an extremely important catalyst for the growth of the organised third party logistics.GST probably for the first time in the history of the country, allows people to build their supply chain design purely from the first principles of the supply chain and not really from taxation point of view. What you will probably see going forward is large scale high efficiency models which will come into play. Both these things put together, we can expect some very interesting times ahead for the industry as a whole and probably specifically for Future Supply Chain also.Complaints about the state of the economy may be in plenty, but a silent revolution is happening in the country that would be a strong foundation for future growth, saysChief Executivein an interview with Joel Rebello and MC Govardhana Rangan.Edited excerpts:We had started writing off rural India after the subsidy-led boom subsided, and when the subsidy got rationalised, some of the boom went away.

However, our customers will now witness a significant reduction in effective prices immediately,” a Jubilant FoodWorks spokesperson said.The spokesperson said Pizza Mania prices have been cut to Rs 62 from Rs 69, while the basic Margherita is down to Rs 104 from Rs 117. Under its Everyday Value Offer, pizza prices have been reduced to Rs 209 from Rs 235.KFC has raised the price of some items and cut that of others. KFC India managing director Rahul Shinde said, “Our menu prices have been updated to be inclusive of GST, and going forward our consumers will pay exactly what they see on the menu board.”A spokesperson for Hardcastle Restaurants, which operates McDonald’s outlets in the west and south, said there had been no increase in prices over the past week. “The government has brought down GST from 18% to 5%, but there has been a removal of input tax credit due to which our operating costs have gone up. We have passed on benefits to consumers wherever we could,” said a Hardcastle spokesperson, adding that it has “‘substantially reduced prices” of flagship products including the Maharaja Mac and spicy chicken and paneer wraps.“Depending on the category of the restaurant, price adjustment exercise to the base menu price had to be done to rationalise the removal of ITC,” said Rahul Singh, president of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI), which represents thousands of outlets. “We welcome reduction in GST slab from a very high 18% to 5% without any distinction of the air-conditioning. However, denying the ITC benefit goes against the grain of GST and will push up the costs by 10%, which will be passed on the menu price. So, effectively the consumer pocket will get a marginal benefit and not as it seems.”A Tata Starbucks spokesperson said, “Like many businesses operating in India, Tata Starbucks adjusted prices following the recent revision of the GST structure. The GST revision included the elimination of the input tax credit, increasing costs for the industry. As a result, we raised our base prices, while still providing savings for our customers after tax on every product.”The chief executive of a large global restaurant chain’s India unit said, “While there is a decrease in prices of some value products, the absence of input tax credit (ITC) has led us to take selective price hikes.” He said it was not possible to pass on all of the tax benefit. “For some popular products, we have maintained prices so that it doesn't impact consumer sales.”Burger King and Pizza Hut didn’t respond to queries.At last month’s GST Council meeting, the rate was slashed to 5% from 18% for all standalone restaurants, irrespective of whether they were air-conditioned or otherwise, without input tax credit. Takeaways and deliveries were also brought down to a flat slab of 5%. The change took effect November 15.
Talking to ET Now , says the business model is asset light and they do not believe in owning the warehouses or owning the trucks unless and until required.Edited excerpts :Yes, it is interesting times and different people, different companies within this third party logistics have probably different business models. Ours is focussed predominantly on the consumption sector firstly and what we have done over a decade or so is that we have created domain expertise around the consumption sector. We have believed in deploying the best-in-class technologies to manage scale and bring in efficiencies.So, by and large, what really distinguishes us is how we are able to provide value to our customers and in terms of business model, largely we are into contract logistics, third party logistics which is where some of these efficiency models come into play.Our third party business or the external business actually spans across the whole consumption sector. We have fairly reputed customers across FMCG, food, fashion, furniture, electronics etc. and the whole business model which we have whether it is for external or for the anchor is largely asset light and we do not believe in owning the warehouses or owning the trucks unless and until required. So, the model is asset light.However, capacities do need to be created but that is more in the form of warehousing space which you end up creating. The warehousing space is where we operate from. They are not really off-the-shelf warehouses. They are custom built. They are world class warehouses which are built according to the specifications we give to the local developers.I am bound by RHP and I really cannot give futuristic projections but if you look at the last few years, the growth has been good. The first half of this month again has been quite aggressive.If you look at whatever has been happening around us, it may be put into two buckets; one within the consumption domain with a lot of our customers, lot of product companies, mid-sized, large-sized enterprises are going through this change in philosophy at their end slowly but surely. There is this whole concept around core competencies and what they should be managing internally.Some of this evolution has been on the IT side for instance, and we believe that is a change which is happening slowly but very surely wherein people are realising that supply chain is a strategic aspect of their business.That is one. The other is a more important change which is around the GST . It has been one of the game changers, an extremely important catalyst for the growth of the organised third party logistics.GST probably for the first time in the history of the country, allows people to build their supply chain design purely from the first principles of the supply chain and not really from taxation point of view. What you will probably see going forward is large scale high efficiency models which will come into play. Both these things put together, we can expect some very interesting times ahead for the industry as a whole and probably specifically for Future Supply Chain also.
Complaints about the state of the economy may be in plenty, but a silent revolution is happening in the country that would be a strong foundation for future growth, saysChief Executivein an interview with Joel Rebello and MC Govardhana Rangan.Edited excerpts:We had started writing off rural India after the subsidy-led boom subsided, and when the subsidy got rationalised, some of the boom went away. Now, a basic infrastructure-led boom is coming. I feel that GDP growth figures all this year, and next, mostly will be driven by urban India. But this base is also growing and if you can bring that up, this should also be a good contributor in the next four-to-five years because volumes are huge. Right now, the GDP concentration is mostly urban and suburban.It’s a clear linkage of reckless lending, reckless borrowing, defaults led by environmental issues, and land acquisition. The reckless borrowing resulted in over-capacities. Those capacities have to be utilised before they put in more money. But there are industries running out of capacities, like the ₹2,000-crore capex announced in cement. Steel is going through a change of hands but steel prices are moving up, which means the demand-supply situation is changing. Capacities are also coming into renewables. In power, there is a large capex in transmission. There is a lot of loan recovery also happening, which is camouflaging the credit growth. It is also depressed by credit substitutes like bonds . But overall, it is patchy because infrastructure is not taking off. We are starting to see some visibility in privatesector capex like in renewable sectors.In my thinking, the guys who are screaming the loudest are the guys who didn’t pay taxes. Their business model was based on tax evasion. They have two options — one is to shut their business and the second is to run it after paying taxes. Most people will choose the latter one, but there is no harm in making a noise. There are some administrative issues but the GST council has been proactive in listening and immediately correcting. I am not shedding tears for those who evade taxes. For decades, we said the salaried guys pay taxes and the fellow who makes sandwiches on the pavement takes home more. Yes, there is a cost to be paid, but don’t we want a larger population to pay taxes rather than just 3% for the whole country? I don’t understand this massive sympathy wave for those who evade taxes. I think people are now starting to reconcile. A change of this scale to go off without any incident is unbelievable anywhere in the world, but to have the courage to do a change of this scale is to my mind laudable.The e-revolution is creating transparency like never before. The auctioning system was once a source of un-transparent dealings and now, all these things are going away. Digitisation is also playing a role in rural India. We call it the ‘rural stack’, which is Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and mobile. The flow of subsidies is happening through Jan Dhan, and Aadhaar is very critical for everything. The mobile phone by itself is a revolution. Reach of the rating agencies is also improving. Two rating agencies, Equifax and Hi-Mark, have got data on every micro-finance borrower. That is going to create more lendability because we now know how much each borrower has borrowed, which rests all speculation on double and triple financing. The credit score is a very strong element from a banking point of view.As banking reaches, the savings which were kept in an earthen pot, stay in the bank. Our pilot with Bharat Financial before the deal found that there is an annual saving capacity of ₹3,000 to ₹4,000 in the hands of a borrower. This large deposit base we are seeing in the Jan Dhan is not fiction. There may have been some misuse during demonetisation , but there is evidence that wages are rising and unemployment is falling. The other move is on rural electrification , roads and sanitation which also have a huge impact. For us, covering rural was a huge problem because our business model was urban and suburban. Today, we are 300 branches in the rural areas, which is a drop in the ocean. Therefore, this potential merger (with Bharat Financial) just fits perfectly, because it gives us 1,450-odd branches, 100,000 villages and seven million customers. We have a growing belief in the future of financial services of banking in the rural areas and that’s what pushed us to do the Bharat transaction.What we have seen is through our MFI partners. There is increasing evidence of the kirana store becoming the ATM. There you can see it effecting activity. Anecdotal evidence is that some of the e-commerce companies are doing micro e-commerce around that. We have seen that for just ₹400, one can install an electric metre, a plug point and a bulb. That itself has the potential for revolutionising activities. The plug point means electricals come in and there is consumption. So, it is not a wave, but a beginning which themselves point to the future. Electrification itself has huge ramifications on consumer goods sales. Data from CMIE is showing slight uptick in wages and downtick in unemployment. All this are signs that plan for investment in the future because it’s coming.I think the trending is towards that. Creditworthiness may not be established, but credit assessment is going to be more robust. The need for surrogate identification and estimation has been replaced by rating agencies. Today, retail lending is more compliant because rating agencies are covering retail. The guy knows if I don’t pay my credit card dues, I won’t get a loan from the banking system forever. That knowledge has taken four to five years to get into the psyche of the borrower with malafide intent. The same trending you will see now with rating agencies covering rural areas. The incidents of double and triple financing are very low. That awareness in rural areas will take some more years.It’s a new process and it will take time. You have to push it, and it is being pushed. Now, regulatory push has forced the pace which is the way to do it, otherwise the system would have moved at its own pace. It puts pressure on the entire system to fast-forward. I completely favour this process and the pace. Banks are also embracing it after initial resistance because it is a good way of resolving it otherwise you keep on bargaining on a bilateral basis. You can argue about the merits and demerits of leaving out the existing promoters, but if you had a situation that a promoter who is not a wilful defaulter had taken the company downhill. Now, there is a haircut in the offering and you buy the same company at a huge haircut its untenable. It will be seen as a dole, so to that extent, there is justification. There is strong merit in amendments.
NEW DELHI: Prices at McDonald’s (in the north and east), Burger King Domino’s and KFC have risen in the past week — at least on some of the costlier items on the menu — despite a cut in goods and services tax (GST) on restaurants because input tax credit is no longer available to them. On the other hand, the quick service restaurant (QSR) chains said some items are now cheaper thanks to the tax reduction. The GST Council slashed rates to 5% from 18% for restaurants with effect from November 15.Increases at McDonald’s (north and east), Burger King, Pizza Hut, Domino’s range from 5% to 8%, while KFC said the rise in price was marginal.
