PUNE: The man-made fibres and yarns were slotted under 18% GST rate while the fabrics were slotted under 5% GST slab with a condition that no refund of Input Tax Credit would be allowed at fabric stage."This was creating a huge inverted duty problem for the synthetic sector and inflating the cost of synthetic products that already had serious threat by cheaper imports. Under the post GST regime, with the abolition of 12.5% Counter Vailing Duty and 4% Special Additional duty, the import has become cheaper.The industry has been pleading the GST Council to reduce MMF yarn GST rate from 18% to 12% to avoid the cost escalation of yarn and facilitate the power loom sector to remain competitive," said P Nataraj, Chairman, the Southern India Mills Association ( SIMA ) in a press release.The industry is happy that the government has reduced GST on MMF filament yarn and MMF spun yarn including filament sewing thread GST rate from 18% to 12%.He said that reduced rate of GST would greatly benefit the spinning and power loom sector, improve global competitiveness and cloth the poor masses of the nation at an affordable cost.Government has given relief for the blockage in credit of exporters that affects the cash liquidity of the exporters. He has hailed the announcement of processing the refund cheques for July exports by 10th October and August exports by 18th October and also the decision for refunding a notional amount for the remaining months and later adjust the amount in the E-Wallet while implemented from 1st April 2018.He has welcomed the announcement of easing the compliance burden of medium and small taxpayers and increasing the eligibility of composition scheme from Rs75 lakhs to Rs 1 Core. Extending the tax exemption for 100% EOU units, Advance Licensing Scheme and EPCG Scheme and also for the merchant exporters with 0.1% tax payment upto 31st March 2018 are few more announcements that benefit the textile industry said, Nataraj.SIMA chief has hoped that the GST Council would soon consider refund of the accumulated input tax credit at fabric stage especially the processed fabrics and also mandating the duty drawback committee to recommend appropriate duty drawback rates and RoSL rates to sustain the export performance.
