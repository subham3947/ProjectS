KOLKATA: Sales of televisions, refrigerators and washing machines dropped by 1-2% this year during Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi compared with last year, creating a flutter in the white goods industry as these two occasions set the tone for sales during the crucial festive season that ends with Diwali.Companies said the decline is due to consumers advancing purchases during the pre-GST sales in June with retailers in a hurry to liquidate stock on a huge discount to minimise losses on transition stock. There was no growth even during the Independence Day sales, which too had become a big shopping period for retailers and brands in the last few years.“Sales in Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi were not as we had expected,” said Godrej Appliances business head Kamal Nandi. “The lag effect of pre-GST sales continued to drag overall demand, though we had expected it to revive.”The industry reported 80-100% growth in sales in June during the GST discounting and several leading retailers like Reliance Digital, Vijay Sales, Viveks and Great Eastern had reported sales at the same scale as Diwali. The companies also believe the 3-4% price hike from July due to GST may have dampened consumer sentiments.“Several brands stayed low with the advertising spend being low this year during Onam compared to last year and consumer promotion and discounts were missing, therefore there was no catalyst for consumers,” said CM Singh, an advisor with Videocon The industry does not expect much change in its fortunes in the first half of September with Durga Puja in East now not a big event for white goods shopping and Shradh in North, when consumers stay away from big purchases.Primary sales — sales from companies to distributors and trade — were severely hit in July due to the delay in GST transition. However, it picked up from August growing by 30-50% with retailers building up their inventory ahead of Diwali.“We expect Diwali sales to pick up from September since it will be a reasonable period since the peak sales in June and the effect of GST completely settling down. Even e-commerce companies will start their discounting and then setting the mood,” said Panasonic India sales head Ajay Seth. He, however, said Panasonic grew sales in August.The companies are going to increase their promotion budget for Diwali doling out gifts and benefits like extended warranty to consumers to push sales. Even advertising spend is likely to go up, industry executives said. The festive period — kicking off with Onam till Diwali — accounts for almost 40% of the white goods industry annual sales
