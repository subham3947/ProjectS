NEW DELHI: India is likely see increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows on the back of reforms such as introduction of the goods and services tax and the bankruptcy code , international ratings agency Moody’s said in a report on Monday.“Combined with reforms such as the introduction of a goods and services tax, which lowers the cost and complexity of doing business, and a simplified and clarified bankruptcy code, FDI is likely to rise further,” the agency said in its report on how structural reforms by Asia Pacific sovereigns could become more effective from stronger global demand.In India, Moody’s said, the government has raised ceilings for authorised FDI in a number of sectors. “FDI has already increased substantially, albeit from a low base,” the report said.FDI in India grew by 18% during 2016 to touch $46 billion, data released by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion showed.The Narendra Modi government has liberalised FDI framework for a number of sectors including insurance, defence and civil aviation and also taken steps towards the ease of doing business. Moody’s said the positive economic impact of India and Indonesia’s measures to attract higher levels of FDI, combined with steps to improve business conditions, are likely to be more apparent in a stronger global macroeconomic environment. The agency has maintained India’s sovereign rating at Baa3 positive.“India and Indonesia’s governments have both implemented reforms over the past few years to improve the overall business climate and, more specifically, to attract FDI,” Moody’s said, adding that a robust global environment is likely to amplify the positive impact of the reforms on the two countries’ attractiveness to foreign investors.Moody’s Investors Service said the strengthening in global demand since the end of last year has buoyed Asia Pacific’s trade-reliant economies, but added that faster export growth has yet to feed into a sustainable acceleration in output growth.NEW DELHI: Global direct selling major Amway today batted for reduction of GST rate on food supplements saying prevention of health issues must also be given similar importance as curatives.Set to complete 20 years of operations in India next year growing at a CAGR of 20 per cent, the company also said it could have grown much faster in the country but for the lack of legislation for direct selling industry.Amway, which expects its Indian operations to touch sales of $1 billion by 2025-26, will cross the Rs 2,000 crore turnover market next year with over half of its current sales coming from food supplements brand Nutrilite."Today GST on pharmaceuticals is 12 per cent. If you strongly believe that prevention is better than cure, why should GST on supplements, which are preventive be more than double that on curative?" Amway Regional President- Europe, India & Africa Samir Behl told PTI.He said under the current GST structure, food supplements under which its brand Nutrilite brand falls, attract the top slab of 28 per cent."It has gone from 14 per cent to 28 per cent for Nutrilite and has impacted our topline," Behl added.Commenting on Amway's journey in India, he said, "Next year we will complete 20 years...we have grown at a CAGR of 20 per cent."Behl further said: "We would have actually grown faster out here but the big challenge the industry faces is about lack of legislation. There is no law which governs the direct selling industry."In 2014, former Amway India MD and CEO William Scott Pinckney was arrested under the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, (PCMCS) following a complaint alleging unethical circulation of money through its operations.The company had then termed the arrest an unwarranted act on frivolous charges that gave a misleading impression about its business.Putting the bitter experience behind, Behl said last year after working closely with the direct selling industry, the ministry of consumer affairs the ministry issued guidelines for the sector, "which is a step in the right direction".The industry is also working with the government so that Consumer Protection Act could be passed in Parliament, he said."Once that can be converted into a law, that will make it that much stronger ... I think legislation combined with a more appropriate GST will add more to the growth momentum," Behl said.Stressing on the need to have a proper law to govern the direct selling industry, he said: "Once we have a legislation in place for the industry, which I feel is currently the single biggest impediment for growth, will certainly help a lot in streamlining and growing the industry faster."
