New Delhi: Come and transporters will not need separate transit passes for moving goods from one state to another as the e-way bill issued to them will be valid throughout India, GST Network said on Friday. For every inter-state movement of goods beyond 10 km which have a value of Rs 50,000 and above, e-way bill is mandatory with effect from February 1, except items exempted by the law.
