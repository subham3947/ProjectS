New Delhi: Following concerns that the form for claiming transitional input tax credit is not available on the GSTN website, the government has extended the date for filing returns under GST by a week. The GST for July has to be paid by August 20. Only after the payment of full GST, Form 3B can be filed. It will be available on the GSTN website from August 21.In view of this, a small window of opportunity is being given to all the taxpayers, the CBEC said.
New Delhi, August 18: Budget passenger airline IndiGo on Friday said it is awaiting certain clarifications regarding GST rates applicable on import of engines which it requires for its grounded A320neo aircraft. The airline also asserted that its pre-scheduled operations are normal and flights are operating on-time. We have 4 neo aircraft grounded due to 4 engines stuck at customs as we are awaiting certain clarifications post the implementation of GST. This has lead to unplanned flight cancellations, IndiGo said in a statement. There is no new development pertaining to the grounding of neos. As we have said on our June earnings’ call, there were instances when up to nine neos were grounded due to inadequate spare engines. The airline added that at present eight of its neos have been grounded due to unavailability of spare engines. These are already factored in our revised schedule which was finalised in June and there are no additional flight cancellations on account of these neos, the statement added.
