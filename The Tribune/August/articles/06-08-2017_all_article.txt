New Delhi, August 5: Tractor parts have been put in the 18% slab On representations that cost of works projects initiated by government have escalated with the GST rate of 18%, from now on, works contracts of Central and state governments have been placed in 12% slab with input tax credit Job work done throughout textile chain will be taxed at 5% following representations on anomalies for different categories.The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council today approved several items for the new indirect tax regime, including rollout of the e-way bill system, lowering the tax rate on works contracts issued by the government, and reducing tax on tractor parts and textile job work. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley appealed to the industry to pass on the benefit of input tax credit under GST to the consumers, otherwise the government will be compelled to use the anti-profiteering provision.After the conclusion of the 20th meeting of the GST Council, he said it has approved the e-way bill system which requires pre-registration of all goods worth over Rs 50,000 before they are moved for sale beyond 10 km. It will not apply to the exempted goods under GST. Jaitley said it will lead to doing away with check-posts and the system will be technology driven with very less human interface. The e-way bill will come into effect from a notified date so that industry and goods carriers have enough time to transition. Jaitley also pointed out that several industries are not passing on the benefits of input tax credit under GST to consumers and appealed to them do so.
