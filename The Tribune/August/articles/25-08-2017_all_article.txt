New Delhi, August 24: Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) has asked taxpayers to upload their invoices on an everyday basis and file their returns early and not wait for the last day so as to have a smoother transition into the new GST regime. Functionality for invoice data upload has been active since July 14. Uploading of invoices is a simple process at the GST Portal and should be completed early in order to avoid delays that are usually witnessed on the last day, GSTN said today. It added that although the GST portal has been made technologically robust and can handle as many as 3.2 billion invoices every month, businessmen must not wait for the last date. Uploading invoices on daily basis has many advantage. It will allow buyers and sellers to verify the amount of purchases and then tally them. This will also enable them to accept or modify the same, said Navin Kumar, Chairman, GSTN.
