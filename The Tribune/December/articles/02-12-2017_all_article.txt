New Delhi, December 1: India’s manufacturing sector in November recorded the strongest improvement in business activity in 13 months as new orders picked up supported by reduction in GST rates and strong demand conditions, a monthly survey said today. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose from 50.3 in October to 52.6 in November, indicating substantial improvement of operating conditions in the country’s manufacturing sector. This is for the fourth consecutive month that the index has come in above 50 point mark that separates expansion from contraction. Growth in output and new orders picked up to the fastest since October 2016, reportedly supported by reductions in GST rates and stronger underlying demand conditions, said Aashna Dodhia, Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.
