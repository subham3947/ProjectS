New Delhi, December 28: The govt will make additional borrowing through dated securities, a move that may put burden on the fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) However, there will be no change in the net borrowing as envisaged in the Budget for 2017-18, a Finance Ministry statement said Besides, it will trim down the T-Bills from present collection of Rs 86,203 crore to Rs 25,006 crore by March 2018 T-Bills are securities with short-term duration of less than one year while dated securities have maturity of over five years The Finance Ministry today announced additional borrowings of Rs 50,000 crore this fiscal through dated securities, leading to speculation about a fiscal slippage on account of the fall in GST revenue collection. The additional borrowings are being watched if they will put burden on the fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of GDP. However, there will be no change in the net borrowings as envisaged in the Budget for 2017-18, a Finance Ministry statement said. After the review of the borrowing programme with the RBI, it was decided that the government will raise additional market borrowings of Rs 50,000 crore only in fiscal FY18 through dated Government securities.The government said it will trim down the T-Bills from present collection of Rs 86,203 crore to Rs 25,006 crore by March 2018. T-Bills are securities with short-term duration of less than one year while dated securities have maturity of over five years. The government will thus, between now and March 2018, not be raising any net additional borrowing (T-Bills will be run down by Rs 61,203 crore and additional G-Sec borrowing will be Rs 50,000 crore), it said. Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA said the change in the long term (market borrowings) and short term (T-bills) issuance calendars neither confirm nor rule out a fiscal slippage in FY2018. A fiscal slippage, if any, may get funded through higher than budgeted small savings collection. She added that the risk of a slippage relative to the fiscal deficit target for FY2018 stems primarily from the growing likelihood that tax revenue, dividends and inflows from other communication services would undershoot the budgeted level.Although the sequential dip in GST collection in November 2017 stems from the cut in rates, it is nevertheless disheartening. Moreover, the extended timelines for filing GST returns imply that the government would receive tax inflows for a large portion of indirect taxes for 11 months in FY2018, Nayar said.
