New Delhi, December 4: It also cut GDP growth forecast for 2018-19 fiscal year to 7.3% from 7.4% predicted in its September Global Economic Outlook It, however, expects GDP growth to pick up in the next two years on back of gradual implementation of the structural reform agenda and higher real disposable income The US-based ratings agency said growth has repeatedly disappointed in recent quarters, partly because of one-off factors, including demonetisation and GST. Days after India’s economy showed signs of recovery, Fitch Ratings today cut the country’s GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.7% from the earlier projected 6.9%, saying the rebound was weaker than expected. It also cut GDP growth forecast for 2018-19 fiscal year to 7.3% from 7.4% predicted in its September Global Economic Outlook (GEO). Fitch, however, expects GDP growth to pick up in the next two years on back of gradual implementation of the structural reform agenda and higher real disposable income. The Indian economy picked up in 3Q17 (July-September), with GDP growing by 6.3% year-on-year, up from 5.7% in 2Q17. However, the rebound was weaker than we expected, and we have reduced our growth forecast for the fiscal year to end-March 2018 (FY18) to 6.7% from 6.9% in the September GEO, Fitch said in its latest GEO. The US-based ratings agency said growth has repeatedly disappointed in recent quarters, partly because of one-off factors, including the demonetisation of November 2016 and disruptions related to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017. Reversing a five-quarter slide in GDP growth, Indian economy bounced back from a three-year low to expand by 6.3% in July-September as manufacturing revved up and businesses adjusted to the new GST tax regime. The GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017-18 compares to 5.7% in April-June, the lowest growth rate since the Narendra Modi government took office, and 7.5% in the September quarter of the previous fiscal. Stating that it expects GDP growth to pick up in the next two years, Fitch said gradual implementation of the structural reform agenda is expected to contribute to higher growth, as will higher real disposable income. Recent moves by the government should help support the growth outlook and enhance business confidence, it said. The two-year bank recapitalisation plan of Rs 2.1 lakh crore, or 1.4% of GDP, is likely to help address the capital shortages that have hindered the banks’ lending capacity. Also, the Rs 6.9 lakh crore, or 4.5 per cent of GDP, road construction plan may encourage the investment growth outlook. Inflation still running at low levels on muted food prices and rupee appreciating quite sharply against the US dollar since the beginning of this year give headroom for the RBI to keep interest rates quite low in order to help lift the economy, Fitch added. 
Mumbai, December 5: Markets turned weak in a choppy trade on Tuesday as cautious investors kept their powder dry ahead of RBI's policy announcement amid subdued macro cues. The Reserve Bank's two-day monetary policy review kicked off today. The central bank is widely expected to keep policy rates unchanged tomorrow and will stay focused on controlling inflation, experts said. The 30-share Sensex opened on a negative note on across-the-board losses and touched a low of 32,682.52. However, value-buying in several heavyweights towards the fag-end trimmed the losses, with the index finishing at 32,802.44, down 67.28 points or 0.20 per cent. The broader NSE Nifty too slipped by 9.50 points, or 0.09 per cent, to end at 10,118.25, after moving between 10,069.10 and 10,147.95. Trading mood was also impacted as Fitch Ratings yesterday cut the country's GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.7 per cent from the earlier projected 6.9 per cent. Services sector activity slipped into the contraction territory during November, post the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) that led to sluggish demand and lower customer turnout, a monthly survey said. "The recent correction in PSU banks provides an opportunity for investors to accumulate as the long term prospects remains strong owing to healthy recapitalisation. "On the macro front upcoming RBI policy and Gujarat state election will be an influential factor for investors which is steering the market to consolidate," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. Meanwhile, foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth net Rs 333.59 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought shares to the tune of Rs 776.18 crore yesterday, as per provisional data. Hero MotoCorp was the worst performer in the Sensex pack, falling 2.31 per cent, followed by Wipro at 2.29 per cent. Other losers included Tata Steel, NTPC, Dr Reddy's, ONGC, Power Grid, Bajaj Auto, L&T, M&M, Asian Paints, HDFC Bank, HUL, Lupin, Coal India, ITC, Tata Motors, Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki and Infosys, falling by up to 1.71 per cent. Bucking the trend, SBI topped the gainers list by rising 1.92 per cent, while Bharti Airtel gained 1.18 per cent. Among the BSE sectoral indices, power fell 1.06 per cent, followed by metal 0.85 per cent, capital goods 0.62 per cent, consumer durables 0.61 per cent, infra 0.56 per cent, auto 0.52 per cent and IT 0.38 per cent. The broader market depicted a mixed trend, with the BSE mid-cap ending up 0.41 per cent, while small-cap index finished 0.03 per cent down. Asian markets retreated, with Japan's Nikkei falling 0.37 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng declining 1.01 per cent and Shanghai Composite Index finishing 0.18 per cent lower.
