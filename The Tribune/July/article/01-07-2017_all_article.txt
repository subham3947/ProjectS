New Delhi, July 1: Telecom regulator TRAI has exhorted the Telecom Department to favourably consider its recommendations to cut levies and relaxing payment period for auctioned spectrum. This, TRAI said, will help ease the financial burden of telcos and keep services affordable. TRAI has also asked the Telecom Department to take up with the Finance Ministry two issues  reduction in GST rate to 5% from 18, and treating telecom as core infrastructure sector. The regulator said it finds considerable merit in these two suggestions made by telecom operators. On several other issues like levies of licence fee, Universal Service Obligation (USO) Fund, spectrum charges, promotion of wireline infrastructure etc, the authority in the past has already given its recommendations to the government, TRAI Principal Advisor, SK Mishra said in a letter to Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Department of Telecom and Chairperson of Telecom Commission. TRAI had favoured reducing USO levy to 3% (compared to 5% of telcos’ revenue) so that effective licence fee is reduced to 6% (compared to 8%).
