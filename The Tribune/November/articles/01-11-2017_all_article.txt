New Delhi, November 1: India’s fiscal deficit at the end of the first half of the current fiscal touched 91.3 per cent of the Budget estimates, which has receded from last month after a growth in corporate tax and IGST collections. During the same period of the last financial year, the deficit was at 83.9 per cent of the target. For 2017-18, the government aims to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3.2 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Last fiscal, it had met the 3.5 per cent target. ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said the surge in corporation tax collections after the advance tax payment, as well as inflows of IGST, contributed to receding revenue and fiscal deficits of the government at end-September from the levels at end-August. Nevertheless, fiscal concerns have not ebbed fully, with the revenue and fiscal deficits in first half of financial year 2018 exceeding the levels recorded in the same period of the previous fiscal,she added. Nayar said concerns regarding a potential slippage relative to the government’s fiscal deficit target for FY2018 continue to linger, particularly on account of lower-than-budgeted revenues given uncertainty related to buoyancy of indirect taxes post-GST, revenues from telecom and disinvestment flows.
