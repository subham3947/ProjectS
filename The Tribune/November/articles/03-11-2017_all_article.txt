New Delhi, November 3: Traders’ body CAIT has demanded a CBI probe against Infosys and other companies concerned on the failure of the GST portal and warned that in a technology based tax system if the technology fails, the entire taxation system will come to a standstill. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said it is seeking the investigation after being disgusted with poor and dismal performance of the GST portal and holding Infosys majorly responsible for the fall out of the portal. Calling it as a betrayal with the nation, the CAIT said even after four months of the GST implementation, the GST portal, which was supposed to function properly from July 1 itself, is still working like an experiment project causing much harassment and mental agony to traders across the country.
