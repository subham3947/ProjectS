New Delhi, November 14: The rate cuts under Goods and Services Tax (GST) for consumer products is likely to boost demand by increasing affordability and the loss of revenue is likely to be met through a shift of trade to the organised segment. With GST rates on 178 goods of mass consumption in the highest tax slab of 28 per cent were cut in the last GST Council meeting driven by monthly tax collections in excess of Rs 90,000 crore during the initial months of the GST rollout, the government believes that the macro revenue picture is not looking bad, analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities said. A research report by the broking house said the reduction in rates is estimated to have an impact of Rs 20,000 crore on government revenue which is likely to be partially offset by shift of trade to the organised segment and volume growth due to price elasticity of demand. Rates were cut on several consumer products such as detergents, shampoos, beauty care, fans from 28 per cent to 18 per cent. The new invoicing would start from November 15. HDFC Securities said in a note the key benefits of this move would be affordability for consumers, as a large portion of the reduction in rates would be passed on to them and lower rates will incentivise players to shift from the unorganised to organised business.
