Washington, October 13: Identifying real estate as the one sector where the maximum amount of tax evasion takes place, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said there was a strong case to bring it under the ambit of the GST. The matter will be discussed in the next meeting of the GST, which will be held on November 9 in Guwahati, Jaitley said, while delivering a lecture at Harvard University. The one sector in India where the maximum amount of tax evasion and cash generation takes place and which is still outside the GST is real estate. Some of the states have been pressing for it. I personally believe that there is a strong case to bring real estate into the GST, Jaitley said, while delivering the ‘Annual Mahindra Lecture’ on India’s tax reforms. In the next meeting itself, we are addressing one of the problem areas or at least (having) a discussion. Some states want, some do not. There are two views. Therefore, by discussion, we would try to reach one view, he said.
