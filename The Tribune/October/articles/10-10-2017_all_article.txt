New Delhi, October 10: Truckers went on a two-day strike from today hitting supplies pan India, with transporters body AIMTC claiming a loss of Rs 2,000 crore to the sector. Truck operators across the country are on a two-day token strike against the GST, high diesel prices, harassment by authorities on roads and toll policies, said the All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC). Our two-day ‘chakka jam’ (strike) which began this morning has hit supplies across the country though we have exempted essential goods. We estimate around Rs 2,000-crore loss to the road transport sector on day one, said Bal Malkit Singh, chairman of the core committee of the AIMTC. Transporters across the country are up in arms against these issues and would chalk out strategies post Diwali to intensify the agitation if the government fails to address the grievances, he said, adding that 12 crore people are associated with the transport sector. Trucks were seen off the roads in many parts of the country, including the national capital. In Mumbai, truck operators would stage a sit-in at Mankhurd check-post, he said. The AIMTC, with over 93 lakh truck operators under its ambit claimed support from several transporter bodies. The two-day token strike called by the AIMTC and supported by all its constituent members was successful on day one with about 70 to 80% of business shut down across the country. We expect similar momentum on the day two, Singh said. It is surprising that the government has chosen to remain indifferent to the critical concerns of the transport sector, which may lead to indefinite nationwide strike after Diwali, he said. The Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT), on the other hand, termed the transporters strike as a damp squib. IFTRT coordinator SP Singh said deliveries were normal in the national capital region and other cities.
