New Delhi, October 21: Nearly 37 lakh GST returns for September have been filed till the evening and 75,000 sales data is being uploaded on the GSTN portal on an hourly basis, its Chairman Ajay Bhushan Pandey said today. The deadline for filing the initial returns in GSTR- 3B for September under the GST regime ends midnight tonight. Pandey said the GSTN system is stable and has been handling data at just 30 per cent of its capacity with 20 lakh returns being uploaded in last two days. Pandey said 36.84 lakh returns have been filed till 7 pm. The pace of filing is picking up with an average 75,000 returns being uploaded on an hourly basis. GSTN system is stable. We hope more people are able to file return within the due date, he said. If we see the capacity of the network, GSTN is using only 30 per cent of its capacity. So, there is a lot of headroom available for the server to upload more number of returns Pandey said. Since the GST rollout on July 1, this is the third month for which businesses have to file GSTR-3B returns listing out details of their sales.  PTI Offline utility The GST Network has launched an Excel-based offline tool for businesses to file initial GSTR- 3B returns. The offline utility is designed to help taxpayers to prepare their GSTR-3B return on their computer system. The taxpayer can download the offline utility from the GST Portal under the download section. This facility will provide an opportunity to the taxpayer to verify details of GSTR-3B before filing returns and to minimise errors, said Prakash Kumar, CEO, GSTN. TNS
