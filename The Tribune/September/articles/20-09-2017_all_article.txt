New Delhi, September 20: Fearing that a staggering Rs 65,000 crore could get stuck in GST refunds, exporters today asked the government to fast-track the refund process and avoid further deterioration in their liquidity situation. The Committee on Exports, chaired by Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia, today met eight export promotion associations to understand their concerns post the implementation of GST. If refund does not start flowing immediately then about Rs 65,000 crore would be stuck by the end of October. This will further deteriorate exporters’ liquidity situation, FIEO Director General Ajay Sahai told reporters after the meeting. He hoped that government would take a decision soon so that exporters get a level-playing field vis-a-vis other sectors.
