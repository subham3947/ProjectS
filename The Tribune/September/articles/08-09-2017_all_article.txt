Chandigarh, September 8: Facing working capital crunch, exporters in Punjab, especially in the SME category, have sought exemption on payment of GST on inputs. They apprehend that the current mechanism of first paying taxes and then applying for refund is a time- consuming process leading to capital shortage. Prior to the implementation of GST, exporters were exempted from paying duties. Being exporters, we were earlier exempted from paying duties on inputs. We used to procure inputs against form ‘H’. Now with GST in place, we have to first pay the tax and then seek refund. There are teething problems in the system. So the refund for July is likely to be reimbursed in September, said SP Sharma, proprietor, Anuj Industries. Since the capital is blocked, this process also leads to increased manufacturing cost as exporters have to pay duties on inputs, he added. The present mechanism has hit small exporters in particular who work on very less margin and resources, said another exporter from Jalandhar. They also claimed that the drawback duties of many exporters were being blocked because of teething issues in the system. This is proving as a stumbling block in getting fresh orders. The working capital of many exporters has been blocked as they are yet to get refund and as a result they are unable to get fresh orders. We have no idea when the government will release the refund. Ashwani Kohli, senior vice-president, Punjab Chamber of Small Exporters, said, Since GST has been implemented only recently, there are teething problems. We hope everything will be sorted out soon and the exporters will get refund in lieu of duties paid. According to GST norms, 90% refund will be given to exporters within seven days of filing the return.
