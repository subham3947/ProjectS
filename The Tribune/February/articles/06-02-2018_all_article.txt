Mumbai, February 6: India’s gold demand grew by 9.1 per cent to 727 tonne in 2017 due to low prices coinciding with Dhanteras, positive economic backdrop and improved consumer sentiment, especially in rural areas, according to a World Gold Council (WGC) report. The total demand stood at 666.1 tonnes in 2016, WGC said in its latest Gold Demand Trends report. The demand was mainly driven by jewellery, which grew as GST stabilised, stock markets performed well and GDP growth leading to better economy and consumer sentiment, particularly in the rural areas, as the effect of demonetisation wore off,WGC Managing Director, India, Somasundaram PR, told PTI. Also, the government’s decision to remove anti-money laundering regulation, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), from jewellery helped boost demand. The growth was mainly driven by jewellery demand in 2017, which was up by 12 per cent at 562.7 tonne compared to 504.5 tonne in 2016. In value terms jewellery demand was up 9 per cent at Rs 1,48,100 crore, from Rs 1,36,290 crore in 2016. Total investment demand was down 2 per cent at 164.2 tonnes in 2017 compared to 161.6 tonnes in 2016. In value terms, gold investment demand fell by 1 per cent at Rs 43,220 crore, from Rs 43,650 crore in 2016. Total gold recycled in India was 88.4 tonnes compared to 79.5 tonnes in 2016. Somasundaram said that in the next two years the growth percentage of coins is expected to be the fastest in India as the base is low. Looking ahead, he said the 2018 Budget confirmed various positive initiatives for gold, including the development of a comprehensive policy and the creation of a gold exchange. As policy measures unfold, we are optimistic that demand for 2018 will stabilise at 700-800 tonne, he added. Talking about net import, he said that in 2017 it grew by 59 per cent to 888 tonne compared to 558 tonne in 2016. For the last quarter of 2017, demand for gold was up 2 per cent at 249.3 tonne compared to 244 tonne in 2016. In value terms, gold demand during the fourth quarter went up by 3 per cent to Rs 66,220 crore against Rs 64,530 crore in the year-ago quarter. Total jewellery demand was up by 4 per cent at 189.6 tonne against 182.2 tonne in the fourth quarter of 2016. Value-wise jewellery demand was Rs 50,370 crore, a rise of 5 per cent from Rs 48,190 crore the last quarter of 2016. Total investment demand for the fourth quarter witnessed a decline of 3 per cent at 59.6 tonne compared with 61.8 tonne in the same period of the previous year. In value terms, gold investment demand was Rs 15,850 crore, a drop of 3 per cent from Rs 16,340 crore in Q4 2016. Total gold recycled in India in the last quarter of 2017 was 17.6 tonnes compared to 16 tonnes in the same period of 2016. PTI
The deferral of fiscal consolidation roadmap has left the task of strengthening weak public finances to the next government after the 2019 general elections, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday. The government has revised its 2018-19 fiscal deficit projections to 3.3 per cent of GDP and for current fiscal to 3.5 per cent of GDP, compared with original targets of 3 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively. The postponement of consolidation in part reflects policies to support the economy, which was held back last year by weak investment and disruptions from demonetisation and the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Fitch said. The Indian government’s budget has pushed back fiscal consolidation, leaving much of the task of addressing the country’s relatively weak public finances to the next administration, Fitch Ratings said in a statement. However, the budget target revisions are modest, and are balanced by positive reform momentum and a strong economic outlook, the US-based agency said. New spending initiatives announced in the budget include measures to boost rural incomes, an ambitious health insurance scheme intended to cover about 50 crore people, and funding for the construction and upgrading of medical colleges and hospitals. This spending will benefit a large section of the public ahead of general elections due by May 2019, Fitch said. The fiscal slippage of 0.3 per cent of GDP in both 2017-18 and 2018-19 is relative to last year’s budget targets of 3.2 per cent and 3 per cent of GDP, respectively. The target for current fiscal was missed largely because of higher expenditure, Fitch said. This government’s initial fiscal plan, set out in 2014, aimed to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by FY18--the level consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act of 2003. It now does not expect to hit that target until 2020-21, beyond its current electoral term, Fitch said. Despite this slippage, the government stated in the budget that it planned to adopt a ceiling of 40 per cent of GDP for central government debt, as recommended by the FRBM Committee in January 2017, compared to an estimated 50 per cent of GDP in 2017-18. This would be a positive step towards a more prudent fiscal framework, if eventually adhered to, even if debt is unlikely to fall below the ceiling by 2022-23, as recommended by the committee, Fitch said. It said the revenue forecasts made in the budget appeared broadly credible. Sluggish investment growth remains a drag on the economy, but a recovery might be supported by a corporate tax change that makes more companies eligible for the lower SME bracket, as well as the government’s continued infrastructure investment drive, it said. The budget decision to increase minimum support prices for agricultural goods to 1.5 times the cost of production is likely to lift rural incomes, but could also push up inflation and bring forward monetary tightening, Fitch noted.

New Delhi, February 6: Global ratings agency Fitch today said the Indian government’s Budget has pushed back fiscal consolidation, leaving much of the task of addressing the country’s relatively weak public finances to the next administration. However, the Budget target revisions are modest, and are balanced by positive reform momentum and a strong economic outlook, Fitch Ratings said.

This spending will benefit a large section of the public ahead of General Election due by May 2019, it said. Fitch said the Budget deficit target for the fiscal year ending March 2019 is set at 3.3% of GDP, down from an expected 3.5% in FY18. This implies fiscal slippage of 0.3% of GDP in both FY18 and FY19 relative to last year’s Budget targets of 3.2% and 3% of GDP, respectively. The target for FY18 was missed largely because of higher expenditure. This government’s initial fiscal plan, set out in 2014, aimed to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP by FY18 the level consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act of 2003.
