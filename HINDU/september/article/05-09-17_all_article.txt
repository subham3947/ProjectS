Services sector contracted for the second month in a row in August as business activity and new work orders were hit by disruptions caused by the new GST regime, a monthly survey showed on Tuesday.Business orders and jobs fell at a slower rate than in July, as per the PMI survey. The Nikkei India Services PMI Business Activity Index improved slightly from 45.9 registered in July to 47.5 in August, but remained below the crucial 50-mark for the second straight month.A contraction for two consecutive months was last seen in November-December 2016 after the government’s demonetisation decision. While manufacturing sector rebounded into growth zone during August, a composite index for services and manufacturing sectors continued to show contraction. “Services acted as a drag on the private sector economy in August, with the reduction in business activity offsetting growth of manufacturing production,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, and author of the report released on Tuesday.
