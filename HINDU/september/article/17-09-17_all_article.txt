Reform measures such as the foreign direct investment reforms, GST and a simplified bankruptcy code are likely to increase FDI in India, according to Moody’s Investors Service. In India, the government has raised ceilings for authorised FDI in a number of sectors,” the agency said in a report on Monday. “FDI has already increased substantially, albeit from a low base. Combined with reforms such as the introduction of a goods and services tax, which lowers the cost and complexity of doing business, and a simplified and clarified bankruptcy code, FDI is likely to rise further,” it said in a report on Monday. It, however, the report added that the benefits of these measures to attract higher levels of FDI and the steps taken to improve business conditions are likely to really have an impact when the global economy improves. “India and Indonesia's governments have both implemented reforms over the past few years to improve the overall business climate and, more specifically, to attract FDI,” the report said. “A robust global environment is likely to amplify the positive impact of the reforms on the two countries' attractiveness to foreign investors.”
