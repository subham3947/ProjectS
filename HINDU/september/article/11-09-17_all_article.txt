Domestic passenger vehicle sales grew 13.8% in August as dealers began restocking vehicles to cash in on fresh demand arising from vehicle price cuts post-GST implementation. Utility vehicle sales led the way surging 19.6% to touch 78,664 units in August, followed by car sales that grew 11.8% to reach 1.99 lakh units, as per data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). “The effects of demonetisation have completely waned and rural markets are coming back on the growth track. Nearly all segments have seen double-digit growth,” said SIAM Director General Vishnu Mathur.
While the month of June experienced a slowdown due to anticipation about GST’s possible impact on prices, Mr. Mathur said that sales in the last two months had been good as there was pent-up demand and a lot of customers wanted to take advantage of the price cuts announced by manufacturers, especially after they learnt about an imminent increase in GST cess rates. “…Whether this is sustainable or not, we will have to wait and see,” Mr. Mathur emphasised. On Saturday, the GST Council approved an increase in the cess levied over and above the 28% GST on mid-sized cars by 2%, large cars by 5% and SUVs by 7%. The hikes came into effect on Monday. While the auto industry is relieved that the government hasn’t raised the cess to the maximum permissible limit of 25%, it has sought an exemption from the 15% cess for 10-13 seater vehicles. “SIAM feels that the long standing anomaly in the taxation of 10-13 seater vehicles could have been fully corrected and these should have been fixed at a GST rate of 28% without any cess as these are public transport vehicles and not for personal use,” it said. Signalling a revival in the rural market, motorcycle sales last month jumped by 12.93% to 11,35,699 units. The same grew around 17% in July and about 3% in June. The sale of scooters grew 18.61% to 6,73,444 units in August. Sales of commercial vehicles also rose by 23.22% to 65,310 units in August.
