More than 13.76 lakh taxpayers filed their returns for August on the Goods and Services Tax portal, according to the GST Network. The last date for filing was September 20. A total of 46.4 lakh taxpayers filed their GSTR-3B forms for July, representing about 78% of all taxpayers registered on the GST Portal and eligible to file GSTR-3B, the GSTN added. “The hourly trend for GSTB-3B for the period August 12 to September 20 shows that about 94% of taxpayers have filed the return between 10 am and 10 pm,” Prakash Kumar, CEO of GSTN said in a release. “Only about 6% have done late in the night or early morning. The trend is the same for other returns as well.” “We would like to underline here that the portal is handling the peak hours smoothly,” said Mr. Kumar. The GSTN, however, noted that the level of tax filing under GST was in line with the level seen prior to the implementation of the indirect tax regime. “Those who were registered in August (10 lakh) and those who have opted for Composition (10 lakh) were not required to file GSTR-3B for July,” the release said. “This level of filing percentile is in consonance with filings under previous indirect tax regime.”
