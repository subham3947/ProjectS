A view of the BSE building in Mumbai.The BSE Sensex recovered over 140 points in early session on Friday after fresh buying in bluechips triggered by positive GDP numbers for the September quarter amid mixed Asian cues.Besides, investors creating new positions following the beginning of the December futures and options (F&O) series also lifted the key indices.The 30-share index, which had lost 575.09 points in the previous three sessions, was trading higher by 140.49 points, or 0.42 per cent, at 33,289.84.All the sectoral indices led by realty, auto and healthcare were trading in the positive zone with gains up to 1.29 per cent.The Nifty also rebounded 43.85 points, or 0.42 per cent, to 10,270.40.Sentiment got a boost after data showed that India’s economy expanded by 6.3 per cent in the July-September quarter as manufacturing revved up and business adjusted to the new GST tax regime, reversing a five-quarter slide in GDP growth, brokers said.Auto stocks were in keen demand on expectations of encouraging November sales data.Big gainers that supported the key indices include Tata Motors, ONGC, TCS, Sun Pharma, L&T, Kotak Bank, Adani Ports, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, Hero MotoCorp, M&M, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC and ITC Ltd with gains of up to 1.22 per cent.A mixed trend at other Asian markets and overnight gains at Wall Street as the Dow Jones finished above 24,000 points for the first time yesterday as the Senate tax cut plan moved closer to passage, too influenced sentiments here.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.01 per cent and Japan’s Nikkei was almost flat in their early sessions while Shanghai Composite index fell 0.20 per cent.Manufacturing activity improved in November to its highest level since October 2016 on the back of growth in new orders and output, a private sector survey showed.The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index recorded a value of 52.6 in November, up from 50.3 in October. A value above 50 denotes an expansion in activity, while one below 50 implies contraction.“The Indian manufacturing sector recorded its strongest improvement in business conditions for 13 months, recording marked and accelerated increases in output and new orders,” the report said. “Furthermore, manufacturing companies observed a renewed increase in new export orders during November.”On employment, the report said greater production requirements in November led to the fastest rate in employment creation since September 2012. “The upward movement in the headline index was driven by a marked increase in output,” it said. “Furthermore, the rate of expansion quickened to the strongest since October 2016. A combination of higher order book volumes and a decrease in GST rates reportedly contributed to greater production.”However, the report said, the rate of growth in production was still lower than the long-term trend witnessed since the survey was started in March 2005.“India’s manufacturing economy advanced on its path to recovery as disruptions from the recent tax reform (GST) continues to diminish,” Aashna Dodhia, economist, HIS Markit and author of the report, said. “Meanwhile, export growth rose for the first time in three months as overseas demand for Indian goods improved.”Mr Dodhia added that the underlying data indicates that the Reserve Bank of India is less likely to adopt an accommodative stance as input cost inflation intensified to the fastest since April.“At the same time, firms were unable to fully pass on higher cost burdens to price-sensitive clients,” she said.
