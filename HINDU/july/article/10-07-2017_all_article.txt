Passenger vehicle sales declined 11% in June as dealers tried to sell existing stocks while avoiding picking up new stocks from carmakers ahead of the roll-out of GST. According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), domestic passenger vehicle sales fell by 11.2% to 1,98,399 units from 2,23,454 a year earlier. While car sales dropped 11.24% to 136,895 units, utility vehicle sales fell 11.25% to 49,547 units and sales of vans slid 10.7% to 11,957. “We only report the wholesale numbers,” SIAM deputy director general Sugato Sen said. “Dealers were trying to eliminate existing stock and were not picking up products as they normally do…as a result we saw the negative impact.” Mr. Sen said the industry, however, expects it to be just a one-month phenomenon. “Next month onwards things will move as dealers will have to replenish their stocks.” Abdul Majeed, Partner, Price Waterhouse said, “All segments, except two wheelers, have not grown mainly due to customers postponing purchase of vehicles due to uncertainty of pricing post GST.” With consumers expecting prices to decrease across all segments under GST “hopefully demand will bounce back in the coming months,” Mr. Majeed said. In two-wheelers, both scooters and motorcycles posted gains. “With good monsoon, hopes are that the trend will continue,” Mr. Sen said. While motorcycle sales rose 2.18% to 9,64,269 units, scooter sales jumped 10.6% to 4,97,478 units. Overall, two wheeler sales increased 4% to 15,27,049 units.
