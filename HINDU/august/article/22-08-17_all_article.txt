India is expected to see a modest recovery in GDP growth at 6.6% for the April—June quarter as compared to 6.1 per cent in January—March, which was affected by demonetisation, says a Nomura report. Economic activity in the country, which had lost some momentum in the run up to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, has started to recover, according to Nomura.The report said while consumption and services growth indicators (especially transportation) bounced back in July, industry, investment and external sector data remain weak, or have slowed down marginally. However, a growth recovery is expected by year-end, aided by remonetisation and improved financial conditions.“Given the impact of the GST and in line with our indicators, we expect only a modest recovery in GDP growth to 6.6% year-on-year in Q2 (April—June) compared to 6.1% in January—March, which was affected by demonetisation. However, in the second half of 2017, we expect growth to accelerate sharply to 7.4%,” it said in a research note.According to Nomura, both urban and rural consumption indicators bounced back in July. While, diesel consumption and consumer credit also picked up, confirming that underlying consumption demand is robust. On the monetary policy front, Nomura said the Reserve Bank of India is expected to maintain the status quo on interest rates.The Reserve Bank in its policy review meet this month has lowered its key lending rate by 0.25%, a move which is likely to translate into lower interest rates for home, auto and other loans as also boost economic activity.
India’s computer shipments dropped 18% to 1.75 million units in the second quarter ended June compared with the same period a year ago due to the impact of Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation.“GST implementation has impacted the business in India even as the effect of demonetisation has subsided,”said Manish Yadav, associate research manager, client devices, IDC India, in a statement on Tuesday. “Further, concerns related to new demand and new investment also turns as binding constraint on business sentiment.”The consumer personal computer market recorded an overall shipment of 0.81 million units in the second quarter of 2017, which is 22.7% lower compared with the same period last year and a 22.6% decline quarter-on-quarter.“Outlook on discretionary spending remained optimistic; however, the channel partners remained cautious and planned for de-stocking due to the impact of the GST implementation, which led to lesser sell-in for Q2 2017 quarter,” said Mr. Yadav.The overall commercial PC market registered a shipment of 0.94 million units in second quarter [April to June]. With the lack of fulfilment of special Government projects and slowness observed in Government spending, the commercial PC market declined by 13.4% year-on-year and 15.3% quarter-on-quarter, according to IDC.HP Inc. continued to lead the overall India personal computer market with 33.8% share in the second quarter. Dell Inc. followed with 17.7% market share and Lenovo held on to the third spot, with a 16.9% market shareThe personal computer market may recover “in due course of time” post GST implementation, according to IDC. “Demand for PCs would be fuelled by small business buying as this segment of business users would look to comply with GST norms which came in effect from July 1 2017,” said Mr. Yadav.
