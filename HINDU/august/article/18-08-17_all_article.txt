Cotton imports may be higher during the current season (October 2016 to September 2017), said the Cotton Advisory Board. In October 2016, the board estimated imports at 17 lakh bales revising the same to 26 lakh bales on Friday. “We are almost at the end of the current season and usually cotton prices will be increasing on a weekly basis at this point of time,” said J. Thulasidharan, chairman, Confederation of Indian Textile Industry. “But, this year, the prices are reducing. This is because the cotton position is comfortable in the country. Imports are up this year,” he said. The board expects the total cotton production in the country during the current season to be 345 lakh bales and consumption by textile mills to be 294 lakh bales. The mills are under financial stress for the last two or three years. With demonetisation and implementation of GST, the industry is hit and the demand for cotton yarn is expected to revive only after Diwali. Cotton yarn exports to China have also come down. All this have reduced cotton consumption by the textile mills, say industry sources. Cotton exports during the current season is expected to be totally 60 lakh bales, according to the Cotton Advisory Board.
